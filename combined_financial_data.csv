      Auditors responsibilities for audit of financial statements,"Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements ‎Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from ‎material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. ‎Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ‎International standards on auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will always detect a material ‎misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or ‎in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis ‎of these financial statements. ‎As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:‎Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, ‎design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and ‎appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is ‎higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions‎, misrepresentations‎, or the override of internal control.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)‎ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that ‎are ‎appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of ‎the ‎Company's internal control.‎Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and ‎related disclosures made by management.‎Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the ‎audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant ‎doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ‎If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related ‎disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions ‎are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions ‎may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.‎Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and ‎whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair ‎presentation.‎‎We communicate with the those charged with governance‎ regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and ‎timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we ‎identify during our audit.‎We have also provided those charged with governance with a statement which states that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements relating to independence. Furthermore, they have been informed with all relations and other matters that we believe reasonably affect our independence and, as appropriate, the relevant safeguard measures.From the matters communicated to those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and, accordingly, are considered the key matters for the audit. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless the law or regulation precludes public disclosure of such matter, or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that matter should not be reported because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng.xls

For assessing impairment, assets are grouped to the lowest level where there are independent cash flows (CGU) that are identifiableNon-financial assets other than goodwill (if any) and those that have experienced impairment are reviewed for the possibility of reversing the impairment at each reporting date. When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable value, provided that it does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recorded in the asset value or cash generating unit in previous years.The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as direct income in the statement of profits or losses and no impairment loss is reversed in goodwill.",,,,,,2//4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng.xls

The provision is determined by reference to a set of factors to ensure that the balances of receivables are not overestimated as a result of the possibility of their un-collectability, on the basis of ageing from the date of initial recognition of receivables to measure ECL. Receivables are grouped based on characteristics of shared credit risk and number of ageing days.The expected loss rates are generated from the company's historical information and adjusted to reflect the expected future outcome which includes any future information on macroeconomic factors such as inflation and GDP growth rate.Employee s’ defined benefits obligations The cost of employees' end of service benefits is determined under the unfunded defined benefit program measured by using the actuarial valuation. An actuarial valuation includes many assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These assumptions include determining the discount rate, future salary increases, employee behavior, and employee turnover. Due to the complexity of the evaluation and its long-term nature, the unfunded defined reward obligation is very sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Therefore, all assumptions are reviewed once or more in one year when necessary.Fair value measurementThe company measures financial instruments at fair value as at the reporting date. The fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly process between two parties in the market at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability.In the most favorable market for assets and liabilities in the non-existence of a primary market.Fair value measurement (Continued)The most favorable market should be available for the company.The fair value of the asset or liability is measured using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and assuming that the participants act in their best interests.When measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset, the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits resulting from the best use of the asset or its sale to another market participant who may use it in the best use is taken into consideration.The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair the value, and it recognizes the increased use of relevant observable inputs and the reduction of the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair values ​​are measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, which is explained below, on the basis of the minimum inputs that is significant to the fair values measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation techniques such that the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement can be directly or indirectly observable.Level 3: Valuation techniques where the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are not observable.If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are located at different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the measurement is completely categorized under the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement as a whole.The company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the change has occurred. As of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019), there are no shifts between levels.",,,,,,2//4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng.xls

         Description of accounting policy for impairment of financial and non-financial assets [text block],"3.4. ImpairmentNon-financial assetsAt the end of each reporting period, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to ‎determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered impairment losses. If any such indication ‎exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine impairment losses (if any).In the ‎event that it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of a specific asset, the company estimates the ‎recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset itself belongs. When a reasonable and ‎consistent basis of allocation can be identified, joint assets are also allocated to cash generating units, or they are ‎allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent basis of Non-financial assets (Continued)allocation ‎can be identified. The cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated is tested to determine the ‎annual impairment, whenever there is an indication of impairment of the unit by comparing the book ‎value of the unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.Intangible assets with indefinite useful ‎life are not amortized. Instead, the asset is tested for impairment annually, whenever there is an indication that the ‎asset is impaired.‎The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less disposal costs or use value. In assessing ‎value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that ‎reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the ‎future cash flow assessment has not been adjusted.‎If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, ‎the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to the recoverable value. Impairment losses ‎are recognized directly in profit or loss.‎When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is ‎increased to the recoverable reassessment, so that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value of the ‎asset (or cash-generating unit) if the impairment loss is not accounted for in the previous years.

         Description of accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting [text block],"‏3.5. Financial instrumentsRecognition of financial assetsThe financial asset and liability are recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual obligations of the instrument, and this is generally done at the trading date. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual cash flows of those assets expire or when the company transfers the right to obtain contractual cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction in which all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred substantially.Financial assets International Financial Reporting Standard‎ (IFRS ‎‏9‏‎) requires that all financial assets to be classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value. The ‎classification is based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow ‎characteristics of the financial assets as shown below, which are determined at the time of initial recognition.‎All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive ‎income as explained below are measured at FVTPL.Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend ‎income, are recognized within profit or loss.‎Financial assets at amortized costFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, if both of the following conditions are met:- That the objective of holding financial assets within the business model is to collect contractual cash flows, and- It arises from the contractual terms of the financial asset, on specific dates cash flows from the principal amount and the interest on principal outstanding only.3.5. Financial instruments (Continued)Financial assets (Continued)Financial assets at amortized cost(continued)When making an assessment of whether assets are held within a business model that aims to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, the company takes into consideration the followings:- Management policies, company objectives, and performance of those policies in practice.-The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within the business model), and in particular, the manner in which those risks are managed.- How does management assesses the portfolio’s performance- Whether the management strategy focuses on earning contractual commission income.- The degree of frequency of any sales of the expected assets.- The reason behind any sales of the assets.Interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency ‎ translation and impairment are recognized within the profit or loss. Any gain or loss arising from de-recognition is recognized within the profit or loss. Financial assets classified as loans and receivables that measured at amortized cost were measured under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” as they are held in the business model to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist of only principal and interest payments.Investments in debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive incomeInvestments in debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured at FVOCI:- It maintains financial assets within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.- The contractual terms of the financial asset give the right on specific dates to cash flows counted from the principal amount and interest on the principal amount.Interest income is recognized in profit or loss. All other changes in the carrying amount of these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and their accumulations under the investment revaluation reserve. When these instruments are disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.The company has no investments in debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income.Upon initial recognition, the company can make an irrevocable selection (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to determine that the investment in equity instruments will be at FVOCI. This is not permitted if the investment is held for the purpose of trading.Holding a financial asset for the purpose of trading is considered if:- It is mainly acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term.- Investment is considered part of a portfolio to make profits in the short term. Or- If they are derivatives.Investments in equity instruments are measured through other comprehensive income, initially at fair value plus transaction costs. Thereafter, it is measured at fair value with gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income. It is never reclassified to profit or loss and no impairment is recognized in the statement of profit or loss.Dividends income is recognized in the statement of profits or losses when the company's right to receive dividends ‎is established in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard No. (15), unless the dividends clearly ‎represent a recovery of part of the investment cost.‎3.5. Financial instruments (Continued)Financial assets (Continued)Investments in debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income(continued)Investment revaluation reserve includes the net cumulative change in the fair value of equity investments measured at FVOCI. When these financial instruments are eliminated, the amount accumulated in the fair value is transferred from reserve to retained earnings.‏Impairment of financial assetsA model is followed for expected credit losses from impairment of financial assets. The expected credit loss model requires that the company account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date in order to demonstrate changes in credit risk from the date of initial registrationIFRS 9 uses the “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The model is applied to financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and to debt instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, not to investments in equity instruments. In accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard No. (9). Measurement of ECL is considered as an indication of the probability of default, or the given default loss (meaning the size of the loss if there is a default). The assessment of the probability of default is based on historical data, which is adjusted by information that forecasts the future.Expected losses are measured as the amount equal to (a) the 12-month expected loss, or (b) the expected loss over the life of the asset.If there has not been a material increase in the credit risk of the financial instruments since their inception date, then a provision is made in an amount equivalent to the expected losses for a period of 12 months, and in some other cases, a provision is made for the expected losses over the life of the assetFor trade receivables with financing components, a simplified approach is available for this, as an assessment of the increase in credit risk is not required at each reporting date. Instead, the company can create a provision for expected losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset.The company decides to take advantage of the life expectancy loss option. For trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component, the company is required to follow the 12-month ECL model.Disposal of financial assetsThe company derecognizes the financial assets only when the contractual rights to cash flows from the assets expire or it transfers the financial assets and the risks and rewards of ownership to another party. If the company does not transfer or retain substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the assets, then it continues to recognize its retained share in the assets and liabilities associated with the financial assets to the amounts that it may have to pay.Financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are classified either at amortized cost or at fair value through profit or loss.All financial liabilities of the company have been classified and measured at amortized cost using the actual return method. The company has no financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.De-recognition of financial liabilitiesThe company derecognizes financial liabilities only when they are fulfilled, canceled or expired.Offsetting between financial assets and liabilities and the net amounts determined in the financial statements takes place when there is a legally enforceable right to set off those included amounts, as well as when the company has an intention to settle them on a net basis or sell the assets to pay the liabilities simultaneously.",,,,,,3//5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng.xls
         Description of other accounting policies relevant to understanding of financial statements [text block],"3.7. Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount less the provision for the expected credit losses and are established mainly by providing goods and services to customers (such as trade receivables). They are recognized initially at fair value plus the direct costs associated with obtaining them, and are subsequently recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.3.20. Earnings per share Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share (if any) are presented for ordinary shares, where basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss of the ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the number of ordinary shares repurchased or issued during the year.

,"20. Classification of financial instruments, fair value measurement and risk management (Continued)20. B. Fair value measurementThe company measures financial instruments such as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income at each statement of financial position date.The fair value represents the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:In the principal market for assets or liabilitiesIn the non-existence of the principle market, in the most advantageous market for the assets or liabilities.The main or most beneficial market must be available to the company.The fair value of the assets or liabilities is measured using assumptions that market participants will use them when pricing the assets or liabilities and on the assumption that market participants seek to achieve the best economic benefits.The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account the ability of market participants to achieve economic benefits by using the asset in the best possible way and the highest possible interest, or by selling it to another market participant, who will use the asset in the best and highest possible interest.The following table shows the analysis of items recorded at fair value according to the level of the fair value hierarchy measurement:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng.xls

,"20. C. Financial risk management The Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value, and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The company's overall risk management program focuses on the fluctuations of the financial markets and the company's management attempts to minimize potential negative impacts on the company's financial performance.Financial risk management frameworkThe risk management policy is implemented by the senior management in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The senior management identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the operating units of the company. The most important types of risk are credit risk, currency risk or fair value and interest rates for cash flows.The Board of Directors has an overall responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Company's risk management framework. The executive management is responsible for developing and monitoring the company's risk management policies. Any changes or matters related to compliance with policies are reported to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee.The risk management regulations are reviewed regularly by the executive management to reflect changes in market conditions and the company's activities. The company aims, through training, management standards and procedures, to develop a responsible and constructive control environment so that all employees are aware of their roles and obligations.The audit committee oversees the management's compliance with the company's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the appropriateness of the risk management framework in relation to the risks encountered by the company.Financial instruments included in the statement of financial position consist of receivables and other current assets, due from associates, accruals and other current liabilities. The methods of evidence used are disclosed in the policy statement relating to each item.20. C. Financial risk management (continued)Financial risk management framework (Continued)Exchange rate riskExchange rate risk arises from changes and fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.The company did not carry out any operations of materiality in currencies other than the Saudi Riyal, the US dollar. Since the Saudi Riyal exchange rate is fixed against the US dollar, it does not represent a significant currency risk. The Company's management monitors the currency exchange rates and believes that the exchange rate risk is immaterial.Share price riskThe company is exposed to market price risks on its investments in traded shares arising from uncertainties surrounding the future value of traded shares. Reports on investment in traded shares are reported to the senior management on a regular basis.21. Significant eventsAt the beginning of the year 2020, the new Corona pandemic (Covid-19) spread, causing disruption to business and economic activities around the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Kingdom took many precautionary measures to confront all the negative consequences of that pandemic.This required the company's management to reassess the main assumptions, estimates and sources applicable to the company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.21. Significant events (Continued)During that year, the management evaluated all effects on the company's operations and activities, and based on this evaluation, there was no need to make any material adjustments to the financial statements for the financial year ending on December 31, 2020, however, given the current uncertainty, any future change In assumptions and estimates, results may arise that require making substantial adjustments to the book values ​​of assets and / or liabilities in future periods, and in view of the rapid development in the current situation with the existence of uncertainty about the future, management will continue to evaluate the impact on the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng.xls

      Auditors responsibilities for audit of financial statements,"Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements ‎Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from ‎material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. ‎Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ‎International standards on auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will always detect a material ‎misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or ‎in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis ‎of these financial statements. ‎As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:‎Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, ‎design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and ‎appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is ‎higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions‎, misrepresentations‎, or the override of internal control.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)‎ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that ‎are ‎appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of ‎the ‎Company's internal control.‎Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and ‎related disclosures made by management.‎Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the ‎audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant ‎doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ‎If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related ‎disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions ‎are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions ‎may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.‎Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and ‎whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair ‎presentation.‎‎We communicate with the those charged with governance‎ regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and ‎timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we ‎identify during our audit.‎We have also provided those charged with governance with a statement which states that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements relating to independence. Furthermore, they have been informed with all relations and other matters that we believe reasonably affect our independence and, as appropriate, the relevant safeguard measures.From the matters communicated to those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and, accordingly, are considered the key matters for the audit. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless the law or regulation precludes public disclosure of such matter, or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that matter should not be reported because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls

The company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Management believes that the actual results may not substantially differ from these estimates. The underlying estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustments to the carrying amounts ​​of assets and liabilities during the next financial year have been explained as follows:",,,,,,2//4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls
         Disclosure of impairment of non-financial assets [text block],"Impairment of non-financial assetsNon-financial assets are reviewed to ascertain whether there are any losses as a result of the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. The impairment loss is recognized in the value by finding the difference between the book value of the asset and the recoverable amount.The recoverable amount is the higher fair value of the asset less costs of sale and the residual value for use. For assessing impairment, assets are grouped to the lowest level where there are independent cash flows (CGU) that are identifiableNon-financial assets other than goodwill (if any) and those that have experienced impairment are reviewed for the possibility of reversing the impairment at each reporting date. When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable value, provided that it does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recorded in the asset value or cash generating unit in previous years.The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as direct income in the statement of profits or losses and no impairment loss is reversed in goodwill.",,,,,,2//4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls
"         Other disclosures on critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions [text block]","Useful lives of property and equipment ‎The management determines the estimated useful lives of property and equipment for calculating depreciation. ‎This estimate is determined after considering expected usage of the assets or physical wear and tear. ‎Management Useful lives of property and equipment (Continued) ‎reviews the residual value and useful lives annually, and future depreciation charges are adjusted ‎where management believes the useful lives differ from previous estimates‎Provision for expected credit losses The company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model to determine the losses of impairment of trade and other receivables. The provision is determined by reference to a set of factors to ensure that the balances of receivables are not overestimated as a result of the possibility of their un-collectability, on the basis of ageing from the date of initial recognition of receivables to measure ECL. Receivables are grouped based on characteristics of shared credit risk and number of ageing days.The expected loss rates are generated from the company's historical information and adjusted to reflect the expected future outcome which includes any future information on macroeconomic factors such as inflation and GDP growth rate.Employee s’ defined benefits obligations The cost of employees' end of service benefits is determined under the unfunded defined benefit program measured by using the actuarial valuation. An actuarial valuation includes many assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These assumptions include determining the discount rate, future salary increases, employee behavior, and employee turnover. Due to the complexity of the evaluation and its long-term nature, the unfunded defined reward obligation is very sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Therefore, all assumptions are reviewed once or more in one year when necessary.Fair value measurementThe company measures financial instruments at fair value as at the reporting date. The fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly process between two parties in the market at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability.In the most favorable market for assets and liabilities in the non-existence of a primary market.Fair value measurement (Continued)The most favorable market should be available for the company.The fair value of the asset or liability is measured using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and assuming that the participants act in their best interests.When measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset, the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits resulting from the best use of the asset or its sale to another market participant who may use it in the best use is taken into consideration.The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair the value, and it recognizes the increased use of relevant observable inputs and the reduction of the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair values ​​are measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, which is explained below, on the basis of the minimum inputs that is significant to the fair values measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation techniques such that the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement can be directly or indirectly observable.Level 3: Valuation techniques where the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are not observable.If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are located at different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the measurement is completely categorized under the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement as a whole.The company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the change has occurred. As of December 31, 2020 (December 31, 2019), there are no shifts between levels.",,,,,,2//4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls

         Description of accounting policy for impairment of financial and non-financial assets [text block],"3.4. ImpairmentNon-financial assetsAt the end of each reporting period, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to ‎determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered impairment losses. If any such indication ‎exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine impairment losses (if any).In the ‎event that it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of a specific asset, the company estimates the ‎recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset itself belongs. When a reasonable and ‎consistent basis of allocation can be identified, joint assets are also allocated to cash generating units, or they are ‎allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent basis of Non-financial assets (Continued)allocation ‎can be identified. The cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated is tested to determine the ‎annual impairment, whenever there is an indication of impairment of the unit by comparing the book ‎value of the unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.Intangible assets with indefinite useful ‎life are not amortized. Instead, the asset is tested for impairment annually, whenever there is an indication that the ‎asset is impaired.‎The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less disposal costs or use value. In assessing ‎value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that ‎reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the ‎future cash flow assessment has not been adjusted.‎If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, ‎the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to the recoverable value. Impairment losses ‎are recognized directly in profit or loss.‎When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is ‎increased to the recoverable reassessment, so that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value of the ‎asset (or cash-generating unit) if the impairment loss is not accounted for in the previous years. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized directly in profit or loss.

         Description of accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting [text block],"‏3.5. Financial instrumentsRecognition of financial assetsThe financial asset and liability are recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual obligations of the instrument, and this is generally done at the trading date. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual cash flows of those assets expire or when the company transfers the right to obtain contractual cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction in which all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred substantially.Financial assets International Financial Reporting Standard‎ (IFRS ‎‏9‏‎) requires that all financial assets to be classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value. The ‎classification is based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow ‎characteristics of the financial assets as shown below, which are determined at the time of initial recognition.‎All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive ‎income as explained below are measured at FVTPL.Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend ‎income, are recognized within profit or loss.‎Financial assets at amortized costFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, if both of the following conditions are met:- That the objective of holding financial assets within the business model is to collect contractual cash flows, and- It arises from the contractual terms of the financial asset, on specific dates cash flows from the principal amount and the interest on principal outstanding only.3.5. Financial instruments (Continued)Financial assets (Continued)Financial assets at amortized cost(continued)When making an assessment of whether assets are held within a business model that aims to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, the company takes into consideration the followings:- Management policies, company objectives, and performance of those policies in practice.-The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within the business model), and in particular, the manner in which those risks are managed.- How does management assesses the portfolio’s performance- Whether the management strategy focuses on earning contractual commission income.- The degree of frequency of any sales of the expected assets.- The reason behind any sales of the assets.Interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency ‎ translation and impairment are recognized within the profit or loss. Any gain or loss arising from de-recognition is recognized within the profit or loss. Financial assets classified as loans and receivables that measured at amortized cost were measured under IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” as they are held in the business model to collect contractual cash flows and these cash flows consist of only principal and interest payments.Investments in debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive incomeInvestments in debt instruments that meet the following conditions are measured at FVOCI:- It maintains financial assets within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets.- The contractual terms of the financial asset give the right on specific dates to cash flows counted from the principal amount and interest on the principal amount.Interest income is recognized in profit or loss. All other changes in the carrying amount of these instruments are recognized in other comprehensive income and their accumulations under the investment revaluation reserve. When these instruments are disposed of, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.The company has no investments in debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income.Upon initial recognition, the company can make an irrevocable selection (on an instrument-by-instrument basis) to determine that the investment in equity instruments will be at FVOCI. This is not permitted if the investment is held for the purpose of trading.Holding a financial asset for the purpose of trading is considered if:- It is mainly acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term.- Investment is considered part of a portfolio to make profits in the short term. Or- If they are derivatives.Investments in equity instruments are measured through other comprehensive income, initially at fair value plus transaction costs. Thereafter, it is measured at fair value with gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income.

Financial instruments (Continued)Financial assets (Continued)Investments in debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income(continued)Investment revaluation reserve includes the net cumulative change in the fair value of equity investments measured at FVOCI. When these financial instruments are eliminated, the amount accumulated in the fair value is transferred from reserve to retained earnings.‏Impairment of financial assetsA model is followed for expected credit losses from impairment of financial assets. The expected credit loss model requires that the company account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date in order to demonstrate changes in credit risk from the date of initial registrationIFRS 9 uses the “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The model is applied to financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and to debt instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, not to investments in equity instruments. In accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard No. (9). Measurement of ECL is considered as an indication of the probability of default, or the given default loss (meaning the size of the loss if there is a default). The assessment of the probability of default is based on historical data, which is adjusted by information that forecasts the future.Expected losses are measured as the amount equal to (a) the 12-month expected loss, or (b) the expected loss over the life of the asset.If there has not been a material increase in the credit risk of the financial instruments since their inception date, then a provision is made in an amount equivalent to the expected losses for a period of 12 months, and in some other cases, a provision is made for the expected losses over the life of the assetFor trade receivables with financing components, a simplified approach is available for this, as an assessment of the increase in credit risk is not required at each reporting date. Instead, the company can create a provision for expected losses based on expected losses over the life of the asset.The company decides to take advantage of the life expectancy loss option. For trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component, the company is required to follow the 12-month ECL model.Disposal of financial assetsThe company derecognizes the financial assets only when the contractual rights to cash flows from the assets expire or it transfers the financial assets and the risks and rewards of ownership to another party. If the company does not transfer or retain substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the assets, then it continues to recognize its retained share in the assets and liabilities associated with the financial assets to the amounts that it may have to pay.Financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are classified either at amortized cost or at fair value through profit or loss.All financial liabilities of the company have been classified and measured at amortized cost using the actual return method. The company has no financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.De-recognition of financial liabilitiesThe company derecognizes financial liabilities only when they are fulfilled, canceled or expired.Offsetting between financial assets and liabilities and the net amounts determined in the financial statements takes place when there is a legally enforceable right to set off those included amounts, as well as when the company has an intention to settle them on a net basis or sell the assets to pay the liabilities simultaneously.",,,,,,3//5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls

,"20. Classification of financial instruments, fair value measurement and risk management (Continued)20. B. Fair value measurementThe company measures financial instruments such as equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income at each statement of financial position date.The fair value represents the price received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:In the principal market for assets or liabilitiesIn the non-existence of the principle market, in the most advantageous market for the assets or liabilities.The main or most beneficial market must be available to the company.The fair value of the assets or liabilities is measured using assumptions that market participants will use them when pricing the assets or liabilities and on the assumption that market participants seek to achieve the best economic benefits.The fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account the ability of market participants to achieve economic benefits by using the asset in the best possible way and the highest possible interest, or by selling it to another market participant, who will use the asset in the best and highest possible interest.The following table shows the analysis of items recorded at fair value according to the level of the fair value hierarchy measurement:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls

,"20. C. Financial risk management The Company's activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value, and price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The company's overall risk management program focuses on the fluctuations of the financial markets and the company's management attempts to minimize potential negative impacts on the company's financial performance.Financial risk management frameworkThe risk management policy is implemented by the senior management in accordance with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The senior management identifies, assesses and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the operating units of the company. The most important types of risk are credit risk, currency risk or fair value and interest rates for cash flows.The Board of Directors has an overall responsibility for establishing and overseeing the Company's risk management framework. The executive management is responsible for developing and monitoring the company's risk management policies. Any changes or matters related to compliance with policies are reported to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee.The risk management regulations are reviewed regularly by the executive management to reflect changes in market conditions and the company's activities. The company aims, through training, management standards and procedures, to develop a responsible and constructive control environment so that all employees are aware of their roles and obligations.The audit committee oversees the management's compliance with the company's risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the appropriateness of the risk management framework in relation to the risks encountered by the company.Financial instruments included in the statement of financial position consist of receivables and other current assets, due from associates, accruals and other current liabilities. The methods of evidence used are disclosed in the policy statement relating to each item.20. C. Financial risk management (continued)Financial risk management framework (Continued)Exchange rate riskExchange rate risk arises from changes and fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates.The company did not carry out any operations of materiality in currencies other than the Saudi Riyal, the US dollar. Since the Saudi Riyal exchange rate is fixed against the US dollar, it does not represent a significant currency risk. The Company's management monitors the currency exchange rates and believes that the exchange rate risk is immaterial.Share price riskThe company is exposed to market price risks on its investments in traded shares arising from uncertainties surrounding the future value of traded shares. Reports on investment in traded shares are reported to the senior management on a regular basis.21. Significant eventsAt the beginning of the year 2020, the new Corona pandemic (Covid-19) spread, causing disruption to business and economic activities around the world, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the Kingdom took many precautionary measures to confront all the negative consequences of that pandemic.This required the company's management to reassess the main assumptions, estimates and sources applicable to the company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020.21. Significant events (Continued)During that year, the management evaluated all effects on the company's operations and activities, and based on this evaluation, there was no need to make any material adjustments to the financial statements for the financial year ending on December 31, 2020, however, given the current uncertainty, any future change In assumptions and estimates, results may arise that require making substantial adjustments to the book values ​​of assets and / or liabilities in future periods, and in view of the rapid development in the current situation with the existence of uncertainty about the future, management will continue to evaluate the impact on the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2021-03-07_14-15-55_Eng (1).xls

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or ‎in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis ‎of these consolidated financial statements. ‎As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

Our conclusions ‎are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions ‎may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.‎Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and ‎whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair ‎presentation.‎Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The Group considers controlling an investee when the Group has:Control of the investee company (existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the activities of the investee).Exposure to risks and rights to various returns from its overlap with the investee company.The ability to use its power over the investee company to affect its returns.The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one of the elements of control described above. The process of consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the group obtains control of the subsidiary and ceases when the group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date the Group acquires control of the subsidiary until the date it ceases.Profits and losses and all components of other comprehensive income are attributable to the equity holders of the Group's parent company and to the holders of the non-controlling interests, even if this results in a deficit balance in favor of the non-controlling interests. When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with the Group's accounting policies.",,,,,,,2\3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls

For assessing impairment, assets are grouped to the lowest level where there are independent cash flows (CGU) that are identifiable.Non-financial assets other than goodwill (if any) and those that have experienced impairment are reviewed for the possibility of reversing the impairment at each reporting date. When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable value, provided that it does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recorded in the asset value or cash generating unit in previous years.The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as direct income in the statement of profits or losses and no impairment loss is reversed in goodwill.",,,,,,,2\5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls

"         Other disclosures on critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions [text block]","Provision for expected credit losses The company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model to determine the losses of impairment of trade and other receivables. The provision is determined by reference to a set of factors to ensure that the balances of receivables are not overestimated as a result of the possibility of their un-collectability, on the basis of ageing from the date of initial recognition of receivables to measure ECL. Receivables are grouped based on characteristics of shared credit risk and number of ageing days.The expected loss rates are generated from the company's historical information and adjusted to reflect the expected future outcome which includes any future information on macroeconomic factors such as inflation and GDP growth rate.Fair value measurementThe company measures financial instruments at fair value as at the reporting date. The fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly process between two parties in the market at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability.In the most favorable market for assets and liabilities in the non-existence of a primary market.The most favorable market should be available for the company.The fair value of the asset or liability is measured using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and assuming that the participants act in their best interests.When measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset, the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits resulting from the best use of the asset or its sale to another market participant who may use it in the best use is taken into consideration.The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair the value, and it recognizes the increased use of relevant observable inputs and the reduction of the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair values ​​are measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, which is explained below, on the basis of the minimum inputs that is significant to the fair values measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation techniques such that the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement can be directly or indirectly observable.Level 3: Valuation techniques where the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are not observable.If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are located at different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the measurement is completely categorized under the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement as a whole.The company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the change has occurred. As of December 31, 2022 (December 31, 2021), there are no shifts between levels.",,,,,,,2\5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls

         Description of accounting policy for financial assets [text block],"3.5.Financial instrumentsRecognition of financial assetsThe financial asset and liability are recognized when the company becomes a party to the contractual obligations of the instrument, and this is generally done at the trading date. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual cash flows of those assets expire or when the company transfers the right to obtain contractual cash flows from the financial asset in a transaction in which all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial assets are transferred substantially.Financial assets International Financial Reporting Standard‎ (IFRS ‎‏9‏‎) requires that all financial assets to be classified and subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value. The ‎classification is based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow ‎characteristics of the financial assets as shown below, which are determined at the time of initial recognition.‎All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive ‎income as explained below are measured at FVTPL.Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend ‎income, are recognized within profit or loss.‎Financial assets at amortized costFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, if both of the following conditions are met:That the objective of holding financial assets within the business model is to collect contractual cash flows, andIt arises from the contractual terms of the financial asset, on specific dates cash flows from the principal amount and the interest on principal outstanding only.When making an assessment of whether assets are held within a business model that aims to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, the company takes into consideration the followings:Management policies, company objectives, and performance of those policies in practice.The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within the business model), and in particular, the manner in which those risks are managed.How does management assesses the portfolio’s performanceWhether the management strategy focuses on earning contractual commission income.The degree of frequency of any sales of the expected assets.The reason behind any sales of the assets.Interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency ‎ translation and impairment are recognized within the profit or loss.

Investments in subsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the company. The company controls an entity when it has the right to variable returns from its involvement with the company and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the company.

,"3.2.Property and equipmentA)Recognition and measurement Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes costs of materials, direct labor and any other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use and the costs of dismantling, removing, and reinstalling the asset on site.When the useful lives of some items of property and equipment are different, they are accounted for as ‎separate components (major components) of property and equipment.‎Profits or losses are determined upon disposal of any item of property and equipment by comparing the amount obtained from disposal with the book value of the asset and is recognized at net within other income in the statement of profits or losses.B)Subsequent costs The cost of replacing any item of property and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the asset if it is probable that economic benefits will flow from that asset to the company. These benefits can be measured reliably and the carrying amount of the replaced part is de-recognized. The daily cost of servicing property and equipment is recognized within the profits or losses as incurred.C)Depreciation Depreciation is calculated over the depreciable amount, which is the cost of the asset or another alternative amount of cost value less the residual value.Depreciation is recognized in the statement of profit or loss using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of each item of property and equipment, as this is the closest method that reflects the expected pattern of depreciation of the economic benefits embodied in the asset.The estimated useful lives for the current year and the comparative year are as follows:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Internally generated intangibles, excluding capitalized development costs, are not capitalized and the related expenditure is reflected in profit or loss when incurred.Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets. The intangible assets of the company are amortized over a period of 5 years. The company does not own any intangible and identifiable assets.",,,,,,,3\16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls
         Description of accounting policy for impairment of financial and non-financial assets [text block],"3.4. Impairment of non-financial assetsNon-financial assetsAt the end of each reporting period, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to ‎determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered impairment losses. If any such indication ‎exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine impairment losses (if any).In the ‎event that it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of a specific asset, the company estimates the ‎recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset itself belongs. When a reasonable and ‎consistent basis of allocation can be identified, joint assets are also allocated to cash generating units, or they are ‎allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation ‎can be identified. The cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated is tested to determine the ‎annual impairment, whenever there is an indication of impairment of the unit by comparing the book ‎value of the unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.Intangible assets with indefinite useful ‎life are not amortized. Instead, the asset is tested for impairment annually, whenever there is an indication that the ‎asset is impaired.‎The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less disposal costs or use value. In assessing ‎value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that ‎reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the ‎future cash flow assessment has not been adjusted.‎If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, ‎the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to the recoverable value. Impairment losses ‎are recognized directly in profit or loss.‎When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is ‎increased to the recoverable reassessment, so that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value of the ‎asset (or cash-generating unit) if the impairment loss is not accounted for in the previous years.The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized in previous periods is not reversed for goodwill in a subsequent period.‏Impairment of financial assetsA model is followed for expected credit losses from impairment of financial assets. The expected credit loss model requires that the company account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date in order to demonstrate changes in credit risk from the date of initial registrationIFRS 9 uses the “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The model is applied to financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and to debt instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, not to investments in equity instruments. In accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard No. (9). Measurement of ECL is considered as an indication of the probability of default, or the given default loss (meaning the size of the loss if there is a default). The assessment of the probability of default is based on historical data, which is adjusted by information that forecasts the future.The company, based on a forward-looking view, assesses the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments as part of its financial assets carried at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.For trade receivables, the Company applies the simplified approach, which requires expected losses to be recorded on a lifetime basis from the date of initial recognition of the trade receivables. To measure expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on common credit risk characteristics and the number of days past due.Expected loss rates have been inferred from the Company's historical information and adjusted to reflect the expected future outcome.",,,,,,,3\4-3\5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The discount is recognized within finance costs.When a recovery is expected (by a third party) for some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision (through an insurance contract for example), the recovered amount is recognized only when it is certain that the refund will be received, if the entity settles the liability. This recoverable amount is recognized as a separate asset.

These assumptions are made after consulting the company’s actuarial expert and include those assumptions that are used to determine normal service cost as well as the financing component of the related liabilities. The qualified actuarial expert calculates the defined benefit obligation using the unit accruals method.The reassessment of defined benefits obligations which consist of actuarial profits and losses is recognized directly in the statement of other comprehensive income. The company determines the net interest expense on the defined benefit obligation for the year by applying the discount rate that is used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year and the net specified liability, after taking into account any change in the net defined benefit obligations during the year as a result of contributions and payments of obligations. The net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in the statement of profits or losses.Short-term employees’ benefitsShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on a non-discounted basis and are expensed when the related service is provided.A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under a short-term cash bonus payment plan or profit share plan if the company has a legal or contractual obligation to pay that amount as a result of a prior service provided by the employee, and if the value of the obligation can be estimated reliably.",,,,,,,3\10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2023-12-05_14-30-57_Eng.xls

         Description of other accounting policies relevant to understanding of financial statements [text block],"Equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (equity instrument investments)The company has elected to recognize changes in the fair value of equity investments in other comprehensive income. These changes are collected within equity under the heading of the valuation reserve for equity instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. The Company may transfer this amount from the reserve to retained earnings upon de-recognition of the relevant shares.These assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Dividends are recognized as income in the statement of profit or loss, except if these dividends represent a recovery of part of the investment cost. Any other losses or gains are recognized in the statement of other comprehensive income and are not reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossThese assets are subsequently measured at fair value. Net profits or losses, including any interests or dividends, are recognized in the profit or loss statement.Measure expected credit lossExpected credit loss is a weighted estimate of credit losses that are measured as the present value of the cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the company and the cash flows that the company expects to receive).Provisions for impairment losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost are presented as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.Disposal of financial assetsThe company derecognizes the financial assets only when the contractual rights to cash flows from the assets expire or it transfers the financial assets and the risks and rewards of ownership to another party. If the company does not transfer or retain substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the assets, then it continues to recognize its retained share in the assets and liabilities associated with the financial assets to the amounts that it may have to pay.Financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are classified either at amortized cost or at fair value through profit or loss.All financial liabilities of the company have been classified and measured at amortized cost using the actual return method. The company has no financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.De-recognition of financial liabilitiesThe company derecognizes financial liabilities only when they are fulfilled, canceled or expired.Offsetting between financial assets and liabilities and the net amounts determined in the financial statements takes place when there is a legally enforceable right to set off those included amounts, as well as when the company has an intention to settle them on a net basis or sell the assets to pay the liabilities simultaneously.3.8.Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at the invoice amount less the provision for the expected credit losses and are established mainly by providing goods and services to customers (such as trade receivables). They are recognized initially at fair value plus the direct costs associated with obtaining them, and are subsequently recognized at amortized cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.3.14.Value added tax (VAT)‎The company is subject to the value-added tax regulation, and the tax is calculated as soon as the invoice is ‎issued, the commodity is delivered or the price or part thereof is received, and the VAT return is submitted on a ‎quarterly basis.‎3.15.Withholding tax The management withholds taxes on non-resident parties - if any - according to the Authority’s regulations, which are not recognized as expenses because the amounts of the obligations on the counterparty are deducted on its behalf.3.22.Earnings per share Basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share (if any) are presented for ordinary shares, where basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss of the ordinary shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for the number of ordinary shares repurchased or issued during the year.

      Auditors responsibilities for audit of financial statements,"Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements‎Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from ‎material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. ‎Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ‎International standards on auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will always detect a material ‎misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or ‎in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis ‎of these financial statements. ‎As part of an audit in accordance with International Standards of Auditing that are endorsed in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:‎Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, ‎design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and ‎appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is ‎higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions‎, misrepresentations‎, or the override of internal control.Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (Continued)‎Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that ‎are ‎appropriate in the circumstances، but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of ‎the ‎Company's internal control. ‎Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and ‎related disclosures made by management.‎Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the ‎audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant ‎doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ‎If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related ‎disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions ‎are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions ‎may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.‎Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and ‎whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair ‎presentation.‎‎We communicate with the those charged with governance‎ regarding، among other matters، the planned scope and ‎timing of the audit and significant audit findings، including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we ‎identify during our audit. ‎We have also provided those charged with governance with a statement which states that we have complied with the relevant ethical requirements relating to independence. Furthermore, they have been informed with all relations and other matters that we believe reasonably affect our independence and, as appropriate, the relevant safeguard measures.From the matters communicated to those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and, accordingly, are considered the key matters for the audit. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless the law or regulation precludes public disclosure of such matter, or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that matter should not be reported because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2022-03-28_13-45-43_Eng.xls

"         Other disclosures on critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions [text block]","The measurement of employee s’ defined benefits obligationsThe cost of employees' end of service benefits is determined under the unfunded defined benefit program measured by using the actuarial valuation. An actuarial valuation includes many assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These assumptions include determining the discount rate, future salary increases, employee behavior, and employee turnover. Due to the complexity of the evaluation and its long-term nature, the unfunded defined reward obligation is very sensitive to changes in these assumptions. Therefore, all assumptions are reviewed once or more in one year when necessary.Impairment of non-financial assetsNon-financial assets are reviewed to ascertain whether there are any losses as a result of the impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the book value may not be recoverable. The impairment loss is recognized in the value by finding the difference between the book value of the asset and the recoverable amount.The recoverable amount is the higher fair value of the asset less costs of sale and the residual value for use. For assessing impairment, assets are grouped to the lowest level where there are independent cash flows (CGU) that are identifiableNon-financial assets other than goodwill (if any) and those that have experienced impairment are reviewed for the possibility of reversing the impairment at each reporting date. When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable value, provided that it does not exceed the carrying value that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recorded in the asset value or cash generating unit in previous years.The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized as direct income in the statement of profits or losses and no impairment loss is reversed in goodwill.Provision for expected credit lossesThe company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model to determine the losses of impairment of trade and other receivables. The provision is determined by reference to a set of factors to ensure that the balances of receivables are not overestimated as a result of the possibility of their un-collectability, on the basis of ageing from the date of initial recognition of receivables to measure ECL. Receivables are grouped based on characteristics of shared credit risk and number of ageing days.The expected loss rates are generated from the company's historical information and adjusted to reflect the expected future outcome which includes any future information on macroeconomic factors such as inflation and GDP growth rate.Fair value measurementThe company measures financial instruments at fair value as at the reporting date. The fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly process between two parties in the market at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the sale of the asset or the transfer of the liability takes place either:In the principal market for the asset or liability.In the most favorable market for assets and liabilities in the non-existence of a primary market.Fair value measurement (Continued)The most favorable market should be available for the company.The fair value of the asset or liability is measured using assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and assuming that the participants act in their best interests.When measuring the fair value of a non-financial asset, the ability of a market participant to generate economic benefits resulting from the best use of the asset or its sale to another market participant who may use it in the best use is taken into consideration.The company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair the value, and it recognizes the increased use of relevant observable inputs and the reduction of the use of unobservable inputs.All assets and liabilities for which fair values ​​are measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, which is explained below, on the basis of the minimum inputs that is significant to the fair values measurement as a whole:Level 1: Quoted (unadjusted) prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation techniques such that the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement can be directly or indirectly observable.Level 3: Valuation techniques where the minimum quantifiable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement are not observable.If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability are located at different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the measurement is completely categorized under the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement as a whole.The company recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period in which the change has occurred. As of December 31, 2021 (December 31, 2020), there are no shifts between levels.",,,,,,2//4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2022-03-28_13-45-43_Eng.xls

The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortization expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognized in the statement of profit or loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible assets.

         Description of accounting policy for impairment of financial and non-financial assets [text block],"3.4.ImpairmentNon-financial assetsAt the end of each reporting period, the company reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets to ‎determine whether there is any indication that these assets have suffered impairment losses. If any such indication ‎exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine impairment losses (if any).In the ‎event that it is not possible to estimate the recoverable value of a specific asset, the company estimates the ‎recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset itself belongs. When a reasonable and ‎consistent basis of allocation can be identified, joint assets are also allocated to cash generating units, or they are ‎allocated to the smallest group of cash generating units for which a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation ‎can be identified.The cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated is tested to determine the ‎annual impairment, whenever there is an indication of impairment of the unit by comparing the book ‎value of the unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of the unit.Intangible assets with indefinite useful ‎life are not amortized. Instead, the asset is tested for impairment annually, whenever there is an indication that the ‎asset is impaired.‎The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value of the asset less disposal costs or use value. In assessing ‎value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that ‎reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the ‎future cash flow assessment has not been adjusted.‎If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, ‎the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to the recoverable value. Impairment losses ‎are recognized directly in profit or loss.‎When the impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is ‎increased to the recoverable reassessment, so that the revised carrying amount does not exceed the value of the ‎asset (or cash-generating unit) if the impairment loss is not accounted for in the previous years. The reversal of an impairment loss is recognized directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognized in previous periods is not reversed for goodwill in a subsequent period.‏Impairment of financial assetsA model is followed for expected credit losses from impairment of financial assets. The expected credit loss model requires that the company account for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date in order to demonstrate changes in credit risk from the date of initial registrationIFRS 9 uses the “expected credit loss” (ECL) model. The model is applied to financial assets that are measured at amortized cost and to debt instruments that are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, not to investments in equity instruments. In accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standard No. (9). Measurement of ECL is considered as an indication of the probability of default, or the given default loss (meaning the size of the loss if there is a default). The assessment of the probability of default is based on historical data, which is adjusted by information that forecasts the future.The company assesses, based on the future outlook, the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments as part of its financial assets carried at amortized cost and fair value through other comprehensive income.For trade receivable, the company applies the simplified approach, which requires recording expected losses on the basis of age from the date of first recognition of the receivable. To measure expected credit losses, receivables have been grouped based on common credit risk characteristics and number of days that are past due.Expected loss rates are derived from the company's historical information and adjusted to reflect the expected future result.",,,,,,3//4-5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2022-03-28_13-45-43_Eng.xls

Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The discount is recognized within finance costs.When a recovery is expected (by a third party) for some or all of the expenditure required to settle a provision (through an insurance contract for example), the recovered amount is recognized only when it is certain that the refund will be received, if the entity settles the liability. This recoverable amount is recognized as a separate asset.The expense relating to the provision is presented in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, net of the amount recovered.",,,,,,3//11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2022-03-28_13-45-43_Eng.xls

These assumptions are made after consulting the company’s actuarial expert and include those assumptions that are used to determine normal service cost as well as the financing component of the related liabilities. The qualified actuarial expert calculates the defined benefit obligation using the unit accruals method.The reassessment of defined benefits obligations which consist of actuarial profits and losses is recognized directly in the statement of other comprehensive income. The company determines the net interest expense on the defined benefit obligation for the year by applying the discount rate that is used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year and the net specified liability, after taking into account any change in the net defined benefit obligations during the year as a result of contributions and payments of obligations. The net interest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognized in the statement of profits or losses.Short-term employees’ benefitsShort-term employee benefit obligations are measured on a non-discounted basis and are expensed when the related service is provided.A liability is recognized for the amount expected to be paid under a short-term cash bonus payment plan or profit share plan if the company has a legal or contractual obligation to pay that amount as a result of a prior service provided by the employee, and if the value of the obligation can be estimated reliably.",,,,,,3//9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2022-03-28_13-45-43_Eng.xls

The ‎classification is based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow ‎characteristics of the financial assets as shown below, which are determined at the time of initial recognition.‎All financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at fair value through other comprehensive ‎income as explained below are measured at FVTPL.Net gains and losses, including any interest or dividend ‎income, are recognized within profit or loss.‎Financial assets at amortized costFinancial assets are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, if both of the following conditions are met:That the objective of holding financial assets within the business model is to collect contractual cash flows, andIt arises from the contractual terms of the financial asset, on specific dates cash flows from the principal amount and the interest on principal outstanding only.When making an assessment of whether assets are held within a business model that aims to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows, the company takes into consideration the followings:Management policies, company objectives, and performance of those policies in practice.The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within the business model), and in particular, the manner in which those risks are managed.How does management assesses the portfolio’s performanceWhether the management strategy focuses on earning contractual commission income.The degree of frequency of any sales of the expected assets.The reason behind any sales of the assets.Interest income and gains and losses from foreign currency ‎ translation and impairment are recognized within the profit or loss.

,"(10.1) The company provided a bank guarantee to the Saudi British Bank (SABB) against the bank facilities granted to the Arab Company for Sulfonates Ltd. (an associate) with sum of SR 5.1 million, which represents 34% of the total value of the bank facilities granted to the associate according to the company's share capital. Due to the default of the associate and its inability to pay the bank facilities according to their due date, the bank submitted a claim to the company to pay the indebtedness‎ of the Arab Company for Sulfonates Ltd., in addition to any fees not yet due after October 21, 2015.On April 12, 2017, the Saudi British Bank (SABB) filed a lawsuit against the Arab Company for Sulfonates Ltd. and the company by its capacity as guarantor of the facilities and claimed payment of the amounts due. On February 03, 2019, the judgment of the Fourteenth Executive Circuit of the Execution Court in Jeddah was issued demanding the Arab Sulfonate Company Ltd. to pay the amount of the claim.Therefore, the management, as a hedge, made a provision for the value of the company’s share of the bank guarantee and did not make any additional provision for fees resulting from default to pay the value of the bank guarantee.On September 9, 2021, the Saudi British Bank (SABB) agreed to deduct 30% of the bank guarantee value that amounted to SR. 5.1 million, and accordingly, only SR. 3.57 million was paid, provided that the bank absolves the Saudi Arabian Refineries Company from any future claims, therefore, the amount of SR. 1.52 million was refunded to the profit or loss statement.On October 19, 2021, an agreement was signed between the Saudi British Bank (SABB) and the company, accordingly, the bank absolved the Saudi Arabian Refineries Company from any future claims related to the bank guarantee for the Arab Company for Sulfonates Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,383_2030_2022-03-28_13-45-43_Eng.xls
