                                 the matters communicated to
                                 those charged with

                                 those matters that were of
                                 most significance in the audit
                                 of the financial statements of

                                 the key matters for the audit.
                                 We describe these matters in
                                 our auditor’s report unless
                                 the law or regulation
                                 precludes public disclosure
                                 of such matter, or when, in
                                 extremely rare
                                 circumstances, we determine
                                 that matter should not be
                                 reported because the
                                 adverse consequences of
                                 doing so would reasonably
     Auditors                    be expected to outweigh the
responsibilities for audit public interest benefits of

                       assetsNon-financial assets
                       are reviewed to ascertain
                       whether there are any losses
                       as a result of the impairment
                       whenever events or changes
                       in circumstances indicate
                       that the book value may not
                       be recoverable. The
                       impairment loss is
                       recognized in the value by
                       finding the difference
                       between the book value of
                       the asset and the
                       recoverable amount.The
                       recoverable amount is the
                       higher fair value of the asset
                       less costs of sale and the

                       reversing the impairment at
                       each reporting date. When
                       the impairment loss is
                       subsequently reversed, the
                       carrying amount of the asset
                       or cash-generating unit is

                        estimates​Provision for
                        expected credit losses The
                        company applies the
                        expected credit loss (ECL)
                        model to determine the
                        losses of impairment of trade
                        and other receivables. The
                        provision is determined by
                        reference to a set of factors
                        to ensure that the balances
                        of receivables are not
                        overestimated as a result of
                        the possibility of their un-
                        collectability, on the basis of
                        ageing from the date of initial
                        recognition of receivables to
                        measure ECL. Receivables
                        are grouped based on
                        characteristics of shared
                        credit risk and number of
                        ageing days.The expected
                        loss rates are generated from
the company's historical
information and adjusted to
reflect the expected future
outcome which includes any
future information on
macroeconomic factors such
as inflation and GDP growth
rate.Employee s’ defined
benefits obligations The cost
of employees' end of service
benefits is determined under
the unfunded defined benefit
program measured by using
the actuarial valuation. An
actuarial valuation includes
many assumptions that may
differ from actual
developments in the future.
These assumptions include
determining the discount
rate, future salary increases,
employee behavior, and
employee turnover. Due to
the complexity of the
evaluation and its long-term
nature, the unfunded defined
reward obligation is very
sensitive to changes in these
assumptions. Therefore, all
assumptions are reviewed
once or more in one year
when necessary.Fair value
measurementThe company
measures financial
instruments at fair value as at
the reporting date. The fair
value is the price to sell an
asset or transfer a liability in
an orderly process between
two parties in the market at
the measurement date. The
fair value measurement is
based on the presumption
that the sale of the asset or
the transfer of the liability
takes place either:In the
principal market for the asset
or liability.In the most
favorable market for assets
and liabilities in the non-
existence of a primary
market.Fair value
measurement
(Continued)The most
favorable market should be
available for the
company.The fair value of
the asset or liability is
measured using assumptions
that market participants
would use when pricing the
asset or liability and
assuming that the
participants act in their best
interests.When measuring
the fair value of a non-
financial asset, the ability of a
market participant to
generate economic benefits
resulting from the best use of
the asset or its sale to
another market participant
who may use it in the best
use is taken into
consideration.The company
uses valuation techniques
that are appropriate in the
circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available
to measure fair the value,
and it recognizes the
increased use of relevant
observable inputs and the
reduction of the use of
unobservable inputs.All
assets and liabilities for
which fair values ​are
measured or disclosed in the
financial statements are
categorized within the fair
value hierarchy, which is
explained below, on the basis
of the minimum inputs that is
significant to the fair values
measurement as a
whole:Level 1: Quoted
(unadjusted) prices in an
active market for identical
assets or liabilities.Level 2:
Valuation techniques such
that the minimum quantifiable
inputs that are significant to
the fair value measurement
can be directly or indirectly
observable.Level 3:
Valuation techniques where
the minimum quantifiable
inputs that are significant to
the fair value measurement
are not observable.If the
inputs used to measure the
fair value of an asset or
liability are located at
different levels of the fair
value hierarchy, then the
measurement is completely
categorized under the lowest
level of input that is
significant to the
measurement as a
whole.The company
recognizes transfers between
levels of the fair value
hierarchy at the end of the

3.2. Property and
equipmentA) Recognition
and measurementItems of
property and equipment are
measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation
and accumulated impairment
losses, if any.The cost
includes expenditures that
are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the asset. The
cost of self-constructed
assets includes costs of
materials, direct labor and
any other costs directly
attributable to preparing the
asset for its intended use
and the costs of dismantling,
removing, and reinstalling
the asset on site.When the
useful lives of some items of
property and equipment are
different, they are accounted
for as ​separate components
(major components) of
property and
equipment.​Profits or losses
are determined upon
disposal of any item of
property and equipment by
comparing the amount
obtained from disposal with
the book value of the asset
and is recognized at net
within other income in the
statement of profits or
losses.B) Subsequent
costsThe cost of replacing
any item of property and
equipment is recognized in
the carrying amount of the
asset if it is probable that
economic benefits will flow
from that asset to the
company. These benefits
can be measured reliably
and the carrying amount of
the replaced part is de-
recognized. The daily cost of
servicing property and
equipment is recognized
within the profits or losses as
incurred.C)
DepreciationDepreciation is
calculated over the
depreciable amount, which is
the cost of the asset or
another alternative amount of
cost value less the residual
value.Depreciation is
recognized in the statement
of profit or loss using the
straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of
each item of property and
equipment, as this is the
closest method that reflects
the expected pattern of
depreciation of the economic
benefits embodied in the
asset.The estimated useful
lives for the current year and
the comparative year are as
follows:



                                   %


Furniture and fixtures                 20


Motor vehicles                         20
The company reviews the
methods of depreciation
,useful lives and the residual
values ​of property and
equipment at the end of each
financial year to ensure that
they reflect the benefit
obtained, and if there is a
difference, it is treated as
changes in the accounting
estimates (in the year of
change and subsequent
years).
                         3.4. ImpairmentNon-financial
                         assetsAt the end of each
                         reporting period, the
                         company reviews the
                         carrying amounts of its non-
                         financial assets to ​determine
                         whether there is any
                         indication that these assets
                         have suffered impairment
                         losses. If any such indication
                         ​exists, the recoverable
                          amount of the asset is
                          estimated in order to
                          determine impairment losses
                          (if any).In the ​event that it is
                          not possible to estimate the
                          recoverable value of a
                          specific asset, the company
                          estimates the ​recoverable
                          amount of the cash-
                          generating unit to which the
                          asset itself belongs. When a
                          reasonable and ​consistent
                          basis of allocation can be
                          identified, joint assets are
                          also allocated to cash
                          generating units, or they are
                          ​allocated to the smallest
                           group of cash generating
                           units for which a reasonable

“Financial Instruments” as
they are held in the business
model to collect contractual
cash flows and these cash
flows consist of only principal
and interest
payments.Investments in
debt instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
incomeInvestments in debt
instruments that meet the
following conditions are
measured at FVOCI:- It
maintains financial assets
within a business model
whose objective is achieved
by collecting contractual cash
flows and selling financial
assets.- The contractual
terms of the financial asset
give the right on specific
dates to cash flows counted
from the principal amount
and interest on the principal
amount.Interest income is
recognized in profit or loss.
All other changes in the
carrying amount of these
instruments are recognized in
other comprehensive income
and their accumulations
under the investment
revaluation reserve. When
these instruments are
disposed of, the cumulative
gain or loss previously
recognized in other
comprehensive income is
reclassified to the statement
of profit or loss.The company
has no investments in debt
instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
income.Upon initial
recognition, the company can
make an irrevocable
selection (on an instrument-
by-instrument basis) to
determine that the
investment in equity
instruments will be at FVOCI.
This is not permitted if the
investment is held for the
purpose of trading.Holding a
financial asset for the
purpose of trading is
considered if:- It is mainly
acquired for the purpose of
selling or repurchasing it in
the near term.- Investment is
considered part of a portfolio
to make profits in the short
term. Or- If they are
derivatives.Investments in
equity instruments are
measured through other
comprehensive income,
initially at fair value plus
transaction costs. Thereafter,
it is measured at fair value
with gains and losses
resulting from changes in fair
value recognized in other
comprehensive income. It is
never reclassified to profit or
loss and no impairment is
recognized in the statement
of profit or loss.Dividends
income is recognized in the
statement of profits or losses
when the company's right to
receive dividends ​is
established in accordance
with International Financial
Reporting Standard No. (15),
unless the dividends clearly
​represent a recovery of part
 of the investment cost.​3.5.

 revaluation reserve includes
 the net cumulative change in
 the fair value of equity
 investments measured at
 FVOCI. When these financial
 instruments are eliminated,
 the amount accumulated in
 the fair value is transferred
 from reserve to retained
 earnings.Impairment of
 financial assetsA model is
 followed for expected credit
 losses from impairment of
 financial assets. The
 expected credit loss model
 requires that the company
 account for expected credit
 losses and changes in those
 expected credit losses at
 each reporting date in order
 to demonstrate changes in
 credit risk from the date of
 initial registrationIFRS 9 uses
 the “expected credit loss”
 (ECL) model. The model is
 applied to financial assets
                        that are measured at
                        amortized cost and to debt
                        instruments that are
                        measured at fair value
                        through other comprehensive
                        income, not to investments in
                        equity instruments. In
                        accordance with the
                        International Financial
                        Reporting Standard No. (9).
                        Measurement of ECL is
                        considered as an indication
                        of the probability of default, or
                        the given default loss
                        (meaning the size of the loss
                        if there is a default). The
                        assessment of the probability
                        of default is based on
                        historical data, which is
                        adjusted by information that
                        forecasts the future.Expected
                        losses are measured as the
                        amount equal to (a) the 12-
                        month expected loss, or (b)
                        the expected loss over the
                        life of the asset.If there has
                        not been a material increase
                        in the credit risk of the
                        financial instruments since
                        their inception date, then a
                        provision is made in an
                        amount equivalent to the
                        expected losses for a period
                        of 12 months, and in some
                        other cases, a provision is
                        made for the expected losses
                        over the life of the assetFor
                        trade receivables with
                        financing components, a
                        simplified approach is
                        available for this, as an
                        assessment of the increase
                        in credit risk is not required at
                        each reporting date. Instead,
                        the company can create a
                        provision for expected losses
                        based on expected losses
                        over the life of the asset.The
                        company decides to take
                        advantage of the life
                        expectancy loss option. For
                        trade receivables that do not
                        have a significant financing
                        component, the company is
                        required to follow the 12-
                        month ECL model.Disposal
                        of financial assetsThe
                        company derecognizes the
                        financial assets only when
                        the contractual rights to cash
                        flows from the assets expire
                        or it transfers the financial
                        assets and the risks and
                        rewards of ownership to
                        another party. If the company
                        does not transfer or retain
                        substantially all the risks and
                        benefits of ownership of the
                        assets, then it continues to
                        recognize its retained share
                        in the assets and liabilities
                        associated with the financial
                        assets to the amounts that it
                        may have to pay.Financial
                        liabilitiesFinancial liabilities
                        are classified either at
                        amortized cost or at fair
                        value through profit or
                        loss.All financial liabilities of
                        the company have been
                        classified and measured at
                        amortized cost using the
                        actual return method. The
                        company has no financial
                        liabilities at fair value through
                        profit or loss.De-recognition
                        of financial liabilitiesThe
                        company derecognizes
                        financial liabilities only when
                        they are fulfilled, canceled or
                        expired.Offsetting between

                           instrument will fail to fulfill an
                           obligation and cause the
                           company to incur a financial
                           loss. The Company's
                           financial instruments that are
                           subject to credit risk are
                           primarily comprised of cash
                           and cash equivalents,
                           receivables and other current
                           assets and due from
                           associates. The company
                           deposits its funds in banks
                           with high reliability and
                           creditworthiness. The

                           regarding the size of funds
                           deposited in each bank, and

                            Liquidity riskLiquidity risk is
                            the risk that the company will
                            encounter difficulties in
                            obtaining the necessary
                            financing to meet obligations
                            related to financial
                            instruments. Liquidity risk
                            may arise when the inability
                            to sell a financial asset

                            approximate to its fair value.
                            Liquidity risk is managed
                            through regular monitoring of
                            the adequacy of the available
                            liquidity to meet the financial
                            obligations of the company

B. Fair value
measurementThe company
measures financial
instruments such as equity
instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
income at each statement of
financial position date.The
fair value represents the
price received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly
transaction between market
participants at the
measurement date. The fair
value measurement is based
on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes
place either:In the principal
market for assets or
liabilitiesIn the non-existence
of the principle market, in the
most advantageous market
for the assets or
liabilities.The main or most
beneficial market must be
available to the
company.The fair value of
the assets or liabilities is
measured using assumptions
that market participants will
use them when pricing the
assets or liabilities and on
the assumption that market
participants seek to achieve
the best economic
benefits.The fair value
measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into
account the ability of market

20. C. Financial risk
management The
Company's activities are
exposed to a variety of
financial risks: market risk
(including currency risk, fair
value, and price risk), credit
risk and liquidity risk. The
company's overall risk
management program
focuses on the fluctuations of
the financial markets and the
company's management
attempts to minimize
potential negative impacts on
the company's financial
performance.Financial risk
management frameworkThe
risk management policy is
implemented by the senior
management in accordance
with the policies approved by
the Board of Directors. The
senior management
identifies, assesses and
hedges financial risks in
close cooperation with the
operating units of the
company. The most
important types of risk are
credit risk, currency risk or
fair value and interest rates
for cash flows.The Board of
Directors has an overall
responsibility for establishing
and overseeing the
Company's risk management
framework. The executive
management is responsible
for developing and
monitoring the company's
risk management policies.
Any changes or matters
related to compliance with
policies are reported to the
Board of Directors through
the Audit Committee.The risk
management regulations are
reviewed regularly by the
executive management to
reflect changes in market
conditions and the
company's activities. The
company aims, through
training, management
standards and procedures, to
                           develop a responsible and
                           constructive control
                           environment so that all
                           employees are aware of their
                           roles and obligations.The
                           audit committee oversees the
                           management's compliance
                           with the company's risk
                           management policies and
                           procedures, and reviews the
                           appropriateness of the risk
                           management framework in
                           relation to the risks
                           encountered by the
                           company.Financial

                           riskExchange rate risk arises
                           from changes and
                           fluctuations in the value of
                           financial instruments as a

                           Since the Saudi Riyal

                           against the US dollar, it does
                           not represent a significant
                           currency risk. The
                           Company's management
                           monitors the currency
                           exchange rates and believes
                           that the exchange rate risk is
                           immaterial.Share price

                           2020, the new Corona
                           pandemic (Covid-19) spread,
                           causing disruption to
                           business and economic
                           activities around the world,
                           including the Kingdom of
                           Saudi Arabia, and the
                           Kingdom took many
                           precautionary measures to
                           confront all the negative
                           consequences of that
                           pandemic.This required the
                           company's management to
                           reassess the main
                           assumptions, estimates and

                           (Continued)During that year,
                           the management evaluated
                           all effects on the company's
                           operations and activities, and
                           based on this evaluation,
                           there was no need to make
                           any material adjustments to
                           the financial statements for

                           however, given the current
                           uncertainty, any future
                           change In assumptions and
                           estimates, results may arise
                           that require making
                           substantial adjustments to
                           the book values ​of assets
                           and / or liabilities in future
                           periods, and in view of the
                           rapid development in the
                           current situation with the
                           existence of uncertainty
                           about the future,
                           management will continue to
                           evaluate the impact on the

                            regard.With regard to our
                            audit of the financial
                            statements, it is our
                            responsibility to read the

                            doing so, we consider
                            whether the other information
                            are materially inconsistent
                            with the financial statements

                            otherwise appears to be
                            material error. During our
                            audit, if we conclude that,
                            there are significant errors
                            within this other information,

                          arise from fraud or error and
                          are considered material if,

                                 the matters communicated to

                                 governance, we determine
                                 those matters that were of
                                 most significance in the audit
                                 of the financial statements of
                                 the current period and,
                                 accordingly, are considered
                                 the key matters for the audit.
                                 We describe these matters in
                                 our auditor’s report unless
                                 the law or regulation
                                 precludes public disclosure
                                 of such matter, or when, in
                                 extremely rare
                                 circumstances, we determine
                                 that matter should not be
                                 reported because the
                                 adverse consequences of
                                 doing so would reasonably
     Auditors                    be expected to outweigh the
responsibilities for audit public interest benefits of
of financial statements such communication.

                       Impairment of non-financial
                       assetsNon-financial assets
                       are reviewed to ascertain
                       whether there are any losses
                       as a result of the impairment
                       whenever events or changes
                       in circumstances indicate
                       that the book value may not
                       be recoverable. The
                       impairment loss is
                       recognized in the value by
                       finding the difference
                       between the book value of
                       the asset and the
                       recoverable amount.The
                       recoverable amount is the
                       higher fair value of the asset
                       less costs of sale and the
                       residual value for use. For
                       assessing impairment, assets
                       are grouped to the lowest
                       level where there are
                       independent cash flows

                       experienced impairment are
                       reviewed for the possibility of
                       reversing the impairment at
                       each reporting date. When
                       the impairment loss is
                       subsequently reversed, the
                       carrying amount of the asset
                       or cash-generating unit is
                       increased to the revised
                       estimate of its recoverable
                       value, provided that it does
                       not exceed the carrying value
                       that would have been
                       determined had no
                       impairment loss been

                        expected credit losses The
                        company applies the
                        expected credit loss (ECL)
                        model to determine the
                        losses of impairment of trade
                        and other receivables. The
                        provision is determined by
                        reference to a set of factors
                        to ensure that the balances
                        of receivables are not
                        overestimated as a result of
                        the possibility of their un-
                        collectability, on the basis of
                        ageing from the date of initial
                        recognition of receivables to
                        measure ECL. Receivables
                        are grouped based on
                        characteristics of shared
                        credit risk and number of
                        ageing days.The expected
                        loss rates are generated from
the company's historical
information and adjusted to
reflect the expected future
outcome which includes any
future information on
macroeconomic factors such
as inflation and GDP growth
rate.Employee s’ defined
benefits obligations The cost
of employees' end of service
benefits is determined under
the unfunded defined benefit
program measured by using
the actuarial valuation. An
actuarial valuation includes
many assumptions that may
differ from actual
developments in the future.
These assumptions include
determining the discount
rate, future salary increases,
employee behavior, and
employee turnover. Due to
the complexity of the
evaluation and its long-term
nature, the unfunded defined
reward obligation is very
sensitive to changes in these
assumptions. Therefore, all
assumptions are reviewed
once or more in one year
when necessary.Fair value
measurementThe company
measures financial
instruments at fair value as at
the reporting date. The fair
value is the price to sell an
asset or transfer a liability in
an orderly process between
two parties in the market at
the measurement date. The
fair value measurement is
based on the presumption
that the sale of the asset or
the transfer of the liability
takes place either:In the
principal market for the asset
or liability.In the most
favorable market for assets
and liabilities in the non-
existence of a primary
market.Fair value
measurement
(Continued)The most
favorable market should be
available for the
company.The fair value of
the asset or liability is
measured using assumptions
that market participants
would use when pricing the
asset or liability and
assuming that the
participants act in their best
interests.When measuring
the fair value of a non-
financial asset, the ability of a
market participant to
generate economic benefits
resulting from the best use of
the asset or its sale to
another market participant
who may use it in the best
use is taken into
consideration.The company
uses valuation techniques
that are appropriate in the
circumstances and for which
sufficient data are available
to measure fair the value,
and it recognizes the
increased use of relevant
observable inputs and the
reduction of the use of
unobservable inputs.All
assets and liabilities for
which fair values ​are
measured or disclosed in the
financial statements are
categorized within the fair
value hierarchy, which is
explained below, on the basis
of the minimum inputs that is
significant to the fair values
measurement as a
whole:Level 1: Quoted
(unadjusted) prices in an
active market for identical
assets or liabilities.Level 2:
Valuation techniques such
that the minimum quantifiable
inputs that are significant to
the fair value measurement
can be directly or indirectly
observable.Level 3:
Valuation techniques where
the minimum quantifiable
inputs that are significant to
the fair value measurement
are not observable.If the

3.2. Property and
equipmentA) Recognition
and measurementItems of
property and equipment are
measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation
and accumulated impairment
losses, if any.The cost
includes expenditures that
are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the asset. The
cost of self-constructed
assets includes costs of
materials, direct labor and
any other costs directly
attributable to preparing the
asset for its intended use
and the costs of dismantling,
removing, and reinstalling
the asset on site.When the
useful lives of some items of
property and equipment are
different, they are accounted
for as ​separate components
(major components) of
property and
equipment.​Profits or losses
are determined upon
disposal of any item of
property and equipment by
comparing the amount
obtained from disposal with
the book value of the asset
and is recognized at net
within other income in the
statement of profits or
losses.B) Subsequent
costsThe cost of replacing
any item of property and
equipment is recognized in
the carrying amount of the
asset if it is probable that
economic benefits will flow
from that asset to the
company. These benefits
can be measured reliably
and the carrying amount of
the replaced part is de-
recognized. The daily cost of
servicing property and
equipment is recognized
within the profits or losses as
incurred.C)
DepreciationDepreciation is
calculated over the
depreciable amount, which is
the cost of the asset or
another alternative amount of
cost value less the residual
value.Depreciation is
recognized in the statement
of profit or loss using the
straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of
each item of property and
equipment, as this is the
closest method that reflects
the expected pattern of
depreciation of the economic
benefits embodied in the
asset.The estimated useful
lives for the current year and
the comparative year are as
follows:


                                   %


Furniture and fixtures                 20


Motor vehicles                         20
The company reviews the
methods of depreciation
,useful lives and the residual
values ​of property and
equipment at the end of each
financial year to ensure that
they reflect the benefit
obtained, and if there is a
difference, it is treated as
changes in the accounting
estimates (in the year of
change and subsequent
years).
                         3.4. ImpairmentNon-financial
                         assetsAt the end of each
                         reporting period, the
                         company reviews the
                         carrying amounts of its non-
                         financial assets to ​determine
                         whether there is any
                         indication that these assets
                         have suffered impairment
                         losses. If any such indication
                         ​exists, the recoverable
                          amount of the asset is
                          estimated in order to
                          determine impairment losses
                          (if any).In the ​event that it is
                          not possible to estimate the
                          recoverable value of a
                          specific asset, the company
                          estimates the ​recoverable
                          amount of the cash-
                          generating unit to which the
                          asset itself belongs. When a
                          reasonable and ​consistent
                          basis of allocation can be
                          identified, joint assets are
                          also allocated to cash
                          generating units, or they are
                          ​allocated to the smallest
                           group of cash generating
                           units for which a reasonable
                           and consistent basis of Non-
                           financial assets
                           (Continued)allocation ​can be
                           identified. The cash-
                           generating unit to which the
                           goodwill has been allocated
                           is tested to determine the
                           ​annual impairment, whenever
                            there is an indication of
                            impairment of the unit by
                            comparing the book ​value of
                            the unit, including goodwill,
                            with the recoverable amount
                            of the unit.Intangible assets
                            with indefinite useful ​life are
                            not amortized. Instead, the
                            asset is tested for impairment
                            annually, whenever there is
                            an indication that the ​asset is
                            impaired.​The recoverable
                            amount is the higher of the
                            fair value of the asset less
                            disposal costs or use value.
                            In assessing ​value in use, the
                            estimated future cash flows
                            are discounted to their
                            present value using a pre-tax
                            discount rate that ​reflects
                            current market assessments
                            of the time value of money
                            and the risks specific to the
                            asset for which the ​future
                            cash flow assessment has
                            not been adjusted.​If the
                            recoverable amount of the
                            asset (or cash-generating
                            unit) is estimated to be less
                            than the carrying amount, ​the
                            carrying amount of the asset
                            (or cash-generating unit) is
                            reduced to the recoverable
                            value. Impairment losses ​are
                            recognized directly in profit or
                            loss.​When the impairment
                            loss is subsequently
                            reversed, the carrying
                            amount of the asset (or cash-
                            generating unit) is ​increased
                            to the recoverable
                            reassessment, so that the
                            revised carrying amount does
                            not exceed the value of the

                             unit) if the impairment loss is
                             not accounted for in the
                             previous years. The reversal
                             of an impairment loss is

from the principal amount
and interest on the principal
amount.Interest income is
recognized in profit or loss.
All other changes in the

                        their inception date, then a
                        provision is made in an
                        amount equivalent to the
                        expected losses for a period
                        of 12 months, and in some
                        other cases, a provision is
                        made for the expected losses
                        over the life of the assetFor
                        trade receivables with
                        financing components, a
                        simplified approach is
                        available for this, as an
                        assessment of the increase
                        in credit risk is not required at
                        each reporting date. Instead,
                        the company can create a
                        provision for expected losses
                        based on expected losses
                        over the life of the asset.The
                        company decides to take
                        advantage of the life
                        expectancy loss option. For
                        trade receivables that do not
                        have a significant financing
                        component, the company is
                        required to follow the 12-
                        month ECL model.Disposal
                        of financial assetsThe
                        company derecognizes the
                        financial assets only when
                        the contractual rights to cash
                        flows from the assets expire
                        or it transfers the financial
                        assets and the risks and
                        rewards of ownership to
                        another party. If the company
                        does not transfer or retain
                        substantially all the risks and
                        benefits of ownership of the
                        assets, then it continues to
                        recognize its retained share
                        in the assets and liabilities
                        associated with the financial
                        assets to the amounts that it
                        may have to pay.Financial
                        liabilitiesFinancial liabilities
                        are classified either at
                        amortized cost or at fair
                        value through profit or
                        loss.All financial liabilities of
                        the company have been
                        classified and measured at
                        amortized cost using the
                        actual return method. The
                        company has no financial
                        liabilities at fair value through
                        profit or loss.De-recognition
                        of financial liabilitiesThe
                        company derecognizes
                        financial liabilities only when
                        they are fulfilled, canceled or
                        expired.Offsetting between
                        financial assets and liabilities
                        and the net amounts
                        determined in the financial
                        statements takes place when

                        receivables are stated at the
                        invoice amount less the
                        provision for the expected
                        credit losses and are
                        established mainly by
                        providing goods and services
                        to customers (such as trade
                        receivables). They are
                        recognized initially at fair
                        value plus the direct costs
                        associated with obtaining
                        them, and are subsequently
                        recognized at amortized cost
                        using the effective interest
                        method less provision for

                           Credit riskCredit risk is the
                           risk that a party in a financial
                           instrument will fail to fulfill an
                           obligation and cause the
                           company to incur a financial
                           loss. The Company's
                           financial instruments that are
                           subject to credit risk are
                           primarily comprised of cash
                           and cash equivalents,
                           receivables and other current
                           assets and due from
                           associates. The company
                           deposits its funds in banks
                           with high reliability and
                           creditworthiness. The
                           company has a policy

                           deposited in each bank, and
                           the management does not

                            the risk that the company will
                            encounter difficulties in
                            obtaining the necessary
                            financing to meet obligations
                            related to financial

                            quickly at a value
                            approximate to its fair value.
                            Liquidity risk is managed
                            through regular monitoring of

management (Continued)20.
B. Fair value
measurementThe company
measures financial
instruments such as equity
instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
income at each statement of
financial position date.The
fair value represents the
price received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly
transaction between market
participants at the
measurement date. The fair
value measurement is based
on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes
place either:In the principal
market for assets or
liabilitiesIn the non-existence
of the principle market, in the
most advantageous market
for the assets or
liabilities.The main or most
beneficial market must be
available to the
company.The fair value of
the assets or liabilities is
measured using assumptions
that market participants will
use them when pricing the
assets or liabilities and on
the assumption that market
participants seek to achieve
the best economic
benefits.The fair value
measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into
account the ability of market
participants to achieve
economic benefits by using
the asset in the best possible
way and the highest possible
interest, or by selling it to
another market participant,
who will use the asset in the
best and highest possible
interest.The following table

recorded at fair value

20. C. Financial risk
management The
Company's activities are
exposed to a variety of
financial risks: market risk
(including currency risk, fair
value, and price risk), credit
risk and liquidity risk. The
company's overall risk
management program
focuses on the fluctuations of
the financial markets and the
company's management
attempts to minimize
potential negative impacts on
the company's financial
performance.Financial risk
management frameworkThe
risk management policy is
implemented by the senior
management in accordance
with the policies approved by
the Board of Directors. The
senior management
identifies, assesses and
hedges financial risks in
close cooperation with the
operating units of the
company. The most
important types of risk are
credit risk, currency risk or
fair value and interest rates
for cash flows.The Board of
Directors has an overall
responsibility for establishing
and overseeing the
Company's risk management
framework. The executive
management is responsible
for developing and
monitoring the company's
risk management policies.
Any changes or matters
related to compliance with
policies are reported to the
Board of Directors through
the Audit Committee.The risk
management regulations are
reviewed regularly by the
executive management to
reflect changes in market
conditions and the
company's activities. The
company aims, through
training, management
standards and procedures, to
                           develop a responsible and
                           constructive control
                           environment so that all
                           employees are aware of their
                           roles and obligations.The
                           audit committee oversees the
                           management's compliance
                           with the company's risk
                           management policies and
                           procedures, and reviews the
                           appropriateness of the risk
                           management framework in
                           relation to the risks
                           encountered by the
                           company.Financial

                           riskExchange rate risk arises
                           from changes and
                           fluctuations in the value of
                           financial instruments as a
                           result of changes in foreign
                           exchange rates.The
                           company did not carry out
                           any operations of materiality

                           Saudi Riyal, the US dollar.
                           Since the Saudi Riyal
                           exchange rate is fixed
                           against the US dollar, it does
                           not represent a significant
                           currency risk. The
                           Company's management
                           monitors the currency
                           exchange rates and believes
                           that the exchange rate risk is
                           immaterial.Share price

                           to market price risks on its
                           investments in traded shares
                           arising from uncertainties

                           investment in traded shares
                           are reported to the senior
                           management on a regular

                           2020, the new Corona
                           pandemic (Covid-19) spread,
                           causing disruption to
                           business and economic
                           activities around the world,
                           including the Kingdom of
                           Saudi Arabia, and the
                           Kingdom took many
                           precautionary measures to
                           confront all the negative
                           consequences of that
                           pandemic.This required the
                           company's management to
                           reassess the main
                           assumptions, estimates and

                           (Continued)During that year,
                           the management evaluated

                           operations and activities, and
                           based on this evaluation,
                           there was no need to make

                           however, given the current
                           uncertainty, any future
                           change In assumptions and
                           estimates, results may arise
                           that require making
                           substantial adjustments to

                            assurance is a high level of
                            assurance but is not a

                              most significance in the audit
                              of the consolidated financial

                              considered the key matters
                              for the audit. We describe
                              these matters in our auditor’s
                              report unless the law or
                              regulation precludes public

                              when, in extremely rare
                              circumstances, we determine
                              that matter should not be
                              reported because the
                              adverse consequences of
     Auditors                 doing so would reasonably
responsibilities for audit be expected to outweigh the
of financial statements public interest benefits of
                              such communication.

                            process of consolidation of a
                            subsidiary begins when the

                         assetsNon-financial assets
                         are reviewed to ascertain
                         whether there are any losses
                         as a result of the impairment
                         whenever events or changes
                         in circumstances indicate
                         that the book value may not
                         be recoverable. The
                         impairment loss is
                         recognized in the value by
                         finding the difference
                         between the book value of
                         the asset and the
                         recoverable amount.The
                         recoverable amount is the
                         higher fair value of the asset
                         less costs of sale and the
                         residual value for use. For
                         assessing impairment, assets
                         are grouped to the lowest
                         level where there are
                         independent cash flows
                         (CGU) that are
                         identifiable.Non-financial
                         assets other than goodwill (if
                         any) and those that have
                         experienced impairment are
                         reviewed for the possibility of
                         reversing the impairment at
                         each reporting date. When
                         the impairment loss is
                         subsequently reversed, the
                         carrying amount of the asset
                         or cash-generating unit is
                         increased to the revised
                         estimate of its recoverable
                         value, provided that it does
                         not exceed the carrying value
                         that would have been
                         determined had no
                         impairment loss been
                         recorded in the asset value
                         or cash generating unit in
                         previous years.The reversal

                        program measured by using
                        the actuarial valuation. An
                        actuarial valuation includes
                        many assumptions that may
                        differ from actual
                        developments in the future.
                        These assumptions include
                        determining the discount
                        rate, future salary increases,
                        employee behavior, and
                        employee turnover. Due to
                        the complexity of the
                        evaluation and its long-term

                        Provision for expected credit
                        losses The company applies
                        the expected credit loss
                        (ECL) model to determine
                        the losses of impairment of
                        trade and other receivables.
                        The provision is determined
                        by reference to a set of
                        factors to ensure that the
                        balances of receivables are
                        not overestimated as a result
                        of the possibility of their un-
                        collectability, on the basis of
                        ageing from the date of initial
                        recognition of receivables to
                        measure ECL. Receivables
                        are grouped based on
                        characteristics of shared
                        credit risk and number of
                        ageing days.The expected
                        loss rates are generated from
                        the company's historical
                        information and adjusted to
                        reflect the expected future
                        outcome which includes any

                        rate.Fair value
                        measurementThe company
                        measures financial
                        instruments at fair value as at
                        the reporting date. The fair
                        value is the price to sell an
                        asset or transfer a liability in
                        an orderly process between
                        two parties in the market at
                        the measurement date. The
                        fair value measurement is
                        based on the presumption
                        that the sale of the asset or
                        the transfer of the liability
                        takes place either:In the
                        principal market for the asset
                        or liability.In the most
                        favorable market for assets
                        and liabilities in the non-
                        existence of a primary
                        market.The most favorable
                        market should be available
                        for the company.The fair
                        value of the asset or liability
                        is measured using
                        assumptions that market
                        participants would use when
                        pricing the asset or liability
                        and assuming that the
                        participants act in their best
                        interests.When measuring
                        the fair value of a non-
                        financial asset, the ability of a
                        market participant to
                        generate economic benefits
                        resulting from the best use of
                        the asset or its sale to
                        another market participant
                        who may use it in the best
                        use is taken into
                        consideration.The company
                        uses valuation techniques
                        that are appropriate in the
                        circumstances and for which
                        sufficient data are available
                        to measure fair the value,
                        and it recognizes the
                        increased use of relevant
                        observable inputs and the

                         asset and liability are
                         recognized when the
                         company becomes a party to
                         the contractual obligations of
                         the instrument, and this is
                         generally done at the trading
                         date. The company
                         derecognizes financial assets
                         when the contractual cash
                         flows of those assets expire
                         or when the company

3.2.Property and
equipmentA)Recognition and
measurement Items of
property and equipment are
measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation
and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. The cost
includes expenditures that
are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the asset. The
cost of self-constructed
assets includes costs of
materials, direct labor and
any other costs directly
attributable to preparing the
asset for its intended use
and the costs of dismantling,
removing, and reinstalling
the asset on site.When the
useful lives of some items of
property and equipment are
different, they are accounted
for as ​separate components
(major components) of
property and
equipment.​Profits or losses
are determined upon
disposal of any item of
property and equipment by
comparing the amount
obtained from disposal with
the book value of the asset
and is recognized at net
within other income in the
statement of profits or
losses.B)Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing any
item of property and
equipment is recognized in
the carrying amount of the
asset if it is probable that
economic benefits will flow
from that asset to the
company. These benefits
can be measured reliably
and the carrying amount of
the replaced part is de-
recognized. The daily cost of
servicing property and
equipment is recognized
within the profits or losses as
incurred.C)Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated
over the depreciable amount,
which is the cost of the asset
or another alternative amount
of cost value less the
residual value.Depreciation is
recognized in the statement
of profit or loss using the
straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of
each item of property and
equipment, as this is the
closest method that reflects
the expected pattern of
depreciation of the economic
benefits embodied in the
asset.The estimated useful
lives for the current year and
the comparative year are as
follows:



Item                           Years




Furniture and fixtures         5 years


Transportation means           5 years
The company reviews the
methods of depreciation
,useful lives and the residual
values ​of property and
equipment at the end of each
financial year to ensure that
they reflect the benefit
obtained, and if there is a
difference, it is treated as
changes in the accounting
estimates (in the year of
change and subsequent

                          assetsIntangible assets
                          acquired separately are
                          measured on initial
                          recognition at cost. Following
                          initial recognition, intangible
                          assets are carried at cost
                          less any accumulated
                          amortization and
                          accumulated impairment
                          losses, if any. Internally
                          generated intangibles,
                          excluding capitalized
                          development costs, are not
                          capitalized and the related
                          expenditure is reflected in
                          profit or loss when
                          incurred.Intangible assets
                          with finite lives are amortized
                          over the useful economic life
                          and assessed for impairment
                          whenever there is an
                          indication that the intangible
                          asset may be impaired. The
                          amortization period and the
                          amortization method for an
                          intangible asset with a finite
                          useful life are reviewed at
                          least at the end of each
                          reporting period. Changes in
                          the expected useful life or the
                          expected pattern of
                          consumption of future
                          economic benefits embodied
                          in the asset are considered
                          to modify the amortization
                          period or method, as
                          appropriate, and are treated
                          as changes in accounting
                          estimates. The amortization
                          expense on intangible assets
                          with finite lives is recognized
                          in the statement of profit or
                          loss in the expense category
                          that is consistent with the
                          function of the intangible
                          assets. The intangible assets
                          of the company are

                          financial assetsNon-financial
                          assetsAt the end of each
                          reporting period, the
                          company reviews the
                          carrying amounts of its non-
                          financial assets to ​determine
                          whether there is any
                          indication that these assets
                          have suffered impairment
                          losses. If any such indication
                          ​exists, the recoverable
                           amount of the asset is
                           estimated in order to
                           determine impairment losses
                           (if any).In the ​event that it is
                           not possible to estimate the
                           recoverable value of a
                           specific asset, the company
                           estimates the ​recoverable
                           amount of the cash-
                           generating unit to which the
                           asset itself belongs. When a
                           reasonable and ​consistent
                           basis of allocation can be
                           identified, joint assets are
                           also allocated to cash
                           generating units, or they are
                           ​allocated to the smallest
                            group of cash generating
                            units for which a reasonable
                            and consistent basis of
                            allocation ​can be identified.
                            The cash-generating unit to
                            which the goodwill has been
                            allocated is tested to
                            determine the ​annual
                            impairment, whenever there
                            is an indication of impairment
                            of the unit by comparing the
                            book ​value of the unit,
                            including goodwill, with the
                            recoverable amount of the
                            unit.Intangible assets with
                            indefinite useful ​life are not
                            amortized. Instead, the asset
                            is tested for impairment
                            annually, whenever there is
                            an indication that the ​asset is
                            impaired.​The recoverable
                            amount is the higher of the
                            fair value of the asset less
                            disposal costs or use value.
                            In assessing ​value in use, the
                            estimated future cash flows
                            are discounted to their
                            present value using a pre-tax
                            discount rate that ​reflects
                            current market assessments
                            of the time value of money
                            and the risks specific to the
                            asset for which the ​future
                            cash flow assessment has
                            not been adjusted.​If the
                            recoverable amount of the
                            asset (or cash-generating
                            unit) is estimated to be less
                            than the carrying amount, ​the
                            carrying amount of the asset
                            (or cash-generating unit) is
                            reduced to the recoverable
                            value. Impairment losses ​are
                         recognized directly in profit or
                         loss.​When the impairment
                         loss is subsequently
                         reversed, the carrying
                         amount of the asset (or cash-
                         generating unit) is ​increased
                         to the recoverable
                         reassessment, so that the
                         revised carrying amount does
                         not exceed the value of the
                         ​asset (or cash-generating
                          unit) if the impairment loss is
                          not accounted for in the
                          previous years.The reversal
                          of an impairment loss is
                          recognized directly in profit or
                          loss. An impairment loss
                          recognized in previous
                          periods is not reversed for
                          goodwill in a subsequent
                          period.Impairment of
                          financial assetsA model is
                          followed for expected credit
                          losses from impairment of
                          financial assets. The
                          expected credit loss model
                          requires that the company
                          account for expected credit
                          losses and changes in those
                          expected credit losses at
                          each reporting date in order
                          to demonstrate changes in
                          credit risk from the date of
                          initial registrationIFRS 9 uses
                          the “expected credit loss”
                          (ECL) model. The model is
                          applied to financial assets
                          that are measured at
                          amortized cost and to debt
                          instruments that are
                          measured at fair value
                          through other comprehensive
                          income, not to investments in
                          equity instruments. In
                          accordance with the
                          International Financial
                          Reporting Standard No. (9).
                          Measurement of ECL is
                          considered as an indication
                          of the probability of default, or
                          the given default loss
                          (meaning the size of the loss
                          if there is a default). The
                          assessment of the probability
                          of default is based on
                          historical data, which is
                          adjusted by information that
                          forecasts the future.The
                          company, based on a
                          forward-looking view,
                          assesses the expected credit
                          losses associated with its
                          debt instruments as part of

                          amortized cost and fair value
                          through other comprehensive
                          income.For trade
                          receivables, the Company
                          applies the simplified
                          approach, which requires
                          expected losses to be
                          recorded on a lifetime basis
                          from the date of initial
                          recognition of the trade
                          receivables. To measure
                          expected credit losses, trade
                          receivables have been
                          grouped based on common

                          insurance contract for
                          example), the recovered
                          amount is recognized only
                          when it is certain that the
                          refund will be received, if the
                          entity settles the liability. This
                          recoverable amount is
                          recognized as a separate
                          asset. The expense relating

                          Equity instruments at fair
value through other
comprehensive income
(equity instrument
investments)The company
has elected to recognize
changes in the fair value of
equity investments in other
comprehensive income.
These changes are collected
within equity under the
heading of the valuation
reserve for equity
instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
income. The Company may
transfer this amount from the
reserve to retained earnings
upon de-recognition of the
relevant shares.These assets
are subsequently measured
at fair value. Dividends are
recognized as income in the
statement of profit or loss,
except if these dividends
represent a recovery of part
of the investment cost. Any
other losses or gains are
recognized in the statement
of other comprehensive
income and are not
reclassified to the statement
of profit or loss.Financial
assets at fair value through
profit or lossThese assets are
subsequently measured at
fair value. Net profits or
losses, including any
interests or dividends, are
recognized in the profit or
loss statement.Measure
expected credit lossExpected
credit loss is a weighted
estimate of credit losses that
are measured as the present
value of the cash shortfalls
(i.e. the difference between
the cash flows due to the
company and the cash flows
that the company expects to
receive).Provisions for
impairment losses on
financial assets measured at
amortized cost are presented
as a deduction from the
gross carrying amount of the
assets.Disposal of financial
assetsThe company
derecognizes the financial
assets only when the
contractual rights to cash
flows from the assets expire
or it transfers the financial
assets and the risks and
rewards of ownership to
another party. If the company
does not transfer or retain
substantially all the risks and
benefits of ownership of the
assets, then it continues to
recognize its retained share
in the assets and liabilities
associated with the financial
assets to the amounts that it
may have to pay.Financial
liabilitiesFinancial liabilities
are classified either at
amortized cost or at fair
value through profit or
loss.All financial liabilities of
the company have been
classified and measured at
amortized cost using the
actual return method. The
company has no financial
liabilities at fair value through
profit or loss.De-recognition
of financial liabilitiesThe
company derecognizes
financial liabilities only when
they are fulfilled, canceled or
expired.Offsetting between
financial assets and liabilities
and the net amounts
determined in the financial
statements takes place when
there is a legally enforceable
right to set off those included
amounts, as well as when
the company has an intention
to settle them on a net basis
or sell the assets to pay the
liabilities
simultaneously.3.8.Trade
receivables Trade
receivables are stated at the
invoice amount less the
provision for the expected
credit losses and are
established mainly by
providing goods and services
to customers (such as trade
receivables). They are
recognized initially at fair
value plus the direct costs
associated with obtaining
them, and are subsequently
recognized at amortized cost
using the effective interest
method less provision for
impairment.3.14.Value added
tax (VAT)​The company is
subject to the value-added
tax regulation, and the tax is
calculated as soon as the
                        invoice is ​issued, the
                        commodity is delivered or the
                        price or part thereof is
                        received, and the VAT return
                        is submitted on a ​quarterly

                        shares, where basic earnings
                        per share is calculated by

21. B.Fair value
measurementThe company
measures financial
instruments such as equity
instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
income at each statement of
financial position date.The
fair value represents the
price received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly
transaction between market
participants at the
measurement date. The fair
value measurement is based
on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes
place either:In the principal
market for assets or
liabilitiesIn the non-existence
of the principle market, in the
most advantageous market
for the assets or
liabilities.The main or most
beneficial market must be
available to the
company.The fair value of
the assets or liabilities is
measured using assumptions
that market participants will
use them when pricing the
assets or liabilities and on
the assumption that market
participants seek to achieve
the best economic
benefits.The fair value
measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into
account the ability of market
participants to achieve
economic benefits by using
the asset in the best possible
way and the highest possible
interest, or by selling it to
another market participant,
who will use the asset in the
best and highest possible
interest.21. B.Fair value

                            Statements​Our objectives
                            are to obtain reasonable
                            assurance about whether the
                            financial statements as a

                            fraud or error and to issue an
                            auditors’ report that includes
                            our opinion. ​Reasonable
                            assurance is a high level of
                            assurance but is not a
                            guarantee that an audit
                            conducted in accordance
                            with ​International standards

                            Arabia will always detect a

                            it exists. Misstatements can
                            arise from fraud or error and
                            are considered material if,
                            individually or ​in the
                            aggregate, they could

                            audit in accordance with
                            International Standards of
                            Auditing that are endorsed in
                            the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,
           we exercise professional
           judgment and maintain
           professional skepticism
           throughout the audit. We
           also:​Identify and assess the
           risks of material
           misstatement of the financial
           statements, whether due to
           fraud or error, ​design and
           perform audit procedures

           that is sufficient and
           ​appropriate to provide a
            basis for our opinion. The
            risk of not detecting a
            material misstatement
            resulting from fraud is ​higher
            than for one resulting from
            error, as fraud may involve
            collusion, forgery, intentional
            omissions​,
            misrepresentations​, or the
            override of internal
            control.Auditors’

             circumstances، but not for

             accounting estimates and
             ​related disclosures made by
              management.​Conclude on
              the appropriateness of
              management’s use of the
              going concern basis of
              accounting and, based on the
              ​audit evidence obtained,
               whether a material
               uncertainty exists related to
               events or conditions that may
               cast significant ​doubt on the
               Company’s ability to continue
               as a going concern. ​If we
               conclude that a material
               uncertainty exists, we are
               required to draw attention in
               our auditors’ report to the
               related ​disclosures in the
               financial statements or, if
               such disclosures are
               inadequate, to modify our
               opinion. Our conclusions ​are
               based on the audit evidence
               obtained up to the date of our
               auditors’ report. However,
               future events or conditions
               ​may cause the Company to

                concern.​Evaluate the overall
                presentation, structure and
                content of the financial
                statements, including the
                disclosures, and ​whether the
                financial statements
                represent the underlying
                transactions and events in a
                manner that achieves a fair
                ​presentation.​​We
                 communicate with the those

                 including any significant
                 deficiencies in internal control
                 that we ​identify during our
                 audit. ​We have also provided
                 those charged with
                 governance with a statement
                 which states that we have
                 complied with the relevant
                 ethical requirements relating
                 to independence.
                 Furthermore, they have been
                 informed with all relations
                 and other matters that we
                 believe reasonably affect our
                 independence and, as
                 appropriate, the relevant
                 safeguard measures.From
                 the matters communicated to
                 those charged with
                 governance, we determine
                 those matters that were of
                 most significance in the audit
                 of the financial statements of
                 the current period and,
                 accordingly, are considered
                 the key matters for the audit.
                 We describe these matters in
                 our auditor’s report unless
                 the law or regulation
                 precludes public disclosure
                 of such matter, or when, in
                 extremely rare
                 circumstances, we determine
                 that matter should not be
                 reported because the
                 adverse consequences of
                 doing so would reasonably
Auditors         be expected to outweigh the
responsibilities for audit public interest benefits of
of financial statements such communication.

                          the unfunded defined benefit
                          program measured by using
                          the actuarial valuation. An
                          actuarial valuation includes
                          many assumptions that may

                          developments in the future.
                          These assumptions include

                          the impairment whenever
                          events or changes in
                          circumstances indicate that
                          the book value may not be
                          recoverable. The impairment
                          loss is recognized in the
                          value by finding the
                          difference between the book
                          value of the asset and the
                          recoverable amount.The
                          recoverable amount is the
                          higher fair value of the asset
                          less costs of sale and the
                          residual value for use. For
                          assessing impairment, assets
                          are grouped to the lowest
                          level where there are
                          independent cash flows
                          (CGU) that are
                          identifiableNon-financial
                          assets other than goodwill (if
                          any) and those that have
                          experienced impairment are
                          reviewed for the possibility of
                          reversing the impairment at
                          each reporting date. When
                          the impairment loss is
                          subsequently reversed, the
                          carrying amount of the asset
                          or cash-generating unit is
                          increased to the revised
                          estimate of its recoverable
                          value, provided that it does
                          not exceed the carrying value
                          that would have been
                          determined had no
                          impairment loss been
                          recorded in the asset value
                          or cash generating unit in
                          previous years.The reversal
                          of an impairment loss is
                          recognized as direct income
                          in the statement of profits or
                          losses and no impairment
                        loss is reversed in
                        goodwill.Provision for
                        expected credit lossesThe
                        company applies the
                        expected credit loss (ECL)
                        model to determine the
                        losses of impairment of trade
                        and other receivables. The
                        provision is determined by
                        reference to a set of factors
                        to ensure that the balances
                        of receivables are not
                        overestimated as a result of
                        the possibility of their un-
                        collectability, on the basis of
                        ageing from the date of initial
                        recognition of receivables to
                        measure ECL. Receivables
                        are grouped based on
                        characteristics of shared
                        credit risk and number of
                        ageing days.The expected
                        loss rates are generated from
                        the company's historical
                        information and adjusted to
                        reflect the expected future
                        outcome which includes any
                        future information on
                        macroeconomic factors such
                        as inflation and GDP growth
                        rate.Fair value
                        measurementThe company
                        measures financial
                        instruments at fair value as at
                        the reporting date. The fair
                        value is the price to sell an
                        asset or transfer a liability in
                        an orderly process between
                        two parties in the market at
                        the measurement date. The
                        fair value measurement is
                        based on the presumption
                        that the sale of the asset or
                        the transfer of the liability
                        takes place either:In the

                        existence of a primary

                        available for the
                        company.The fair value of
                        the asset or liability is
                        measured using assumptions
                        that market participants
                        would use when pricing the
                        asset or liability and
                        assuming that the
                        participants act in their best
                        interests.When measuring
                        the fair value of a non-
                        financial asset, the ability of a
                        market participant to
                        generate economic benefits
                        resulting from the best use of
                        the asset or its sale to
                        another market participant
                        who may use it in the best
                        use is taken into
                        consideration.The company
                        uses valuation techniques
                        that are appropriate in the
                        circumstances and for which
                        sufficient data are available
                        to measure fair the value,
                        and it recognizes the
                        increased use of relevant

3.2.Property and
equipmentA)Recognition and
measurement Items of
property and equipment are
measured at cost less
accumulated depreciation
and accumulated impairment
losses, if any. The cost
includes expenditures that
are directly attributable to the
acquisition of the asset. The
cost of self-constructed
assets includes costs of
materials, direct labor and
any other costs directly
attributable to preparing the
asset for its intended use
and the costs of dismantling,
removing, and reinstalling
the asset on site.When the
useful lives of some items of
property and equipment are
different, they are accounted
for as ​separate components
(major components) of
property and
equipment.​Profits or losses
are determined upon
disposal of any item of
property and equipment by
comparing the amount
obtained from disposal with
the book value of the asset
and is recognized at net
within other income in the
statement of profits or
losses.B)Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing any
item of property and
equipment is recognized in
the carrying amount of the
asset if it is probable that
economic benefits will flow
from that asset to the
company. These benefits
can be measured reliably
and the carrying amount of
the replaced part is de-
recognized. The daily cost of
servicing property and
equipment is recognized
within the profits or losses as
incurred.C)Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated
over the depreciable amount,
which is the cost of the asset
or another alternative amount
of cost value less the
residual value.Depreciation is
recognized in the statement
of profit or loss using the
straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of
each item of property and
equipment, as this is the
closest method that reflects
the expected pattern of
depreciation of the economic
benefits embodied in the
asset.The estimated useful

The company reviews the
methods of depreciation
,useful lives and the residual
values ​of property and
equipment at the end of each
financial year to ensure that
they reflect the benefit
obtained, and if there is a
difference, it is treated as
changes in the accounting
estimates (in the year of
change and subsequent
years).

                          assetsIntangible assets
                          acquired separately are
                          measured on initial
                          recognition at cost. Following
                          initial recognition, intangible
                          assets are carried at cost
                          less any accumulated
                          amortization and
                          accumulated impairment
                          losses, if any. Internally
                          generated intangibles,
                          excluding capitalized
                          development costs, are not
                          capitalized and the related
                          expenditure is reflected in
                          profit or loss when
                          incurred.Intangible assets
                          with finite lives are amortized
                          over the useful economic life
                          and assessed for impairment
                          whenever there is an
                          indication that the intangible
                          asset may be impaired. The
                          amortization period and the
                          amortization method for an
                          intangible asset with a finite
                          useful life are reviewed at
                          least at the end of each
                          reporting period. Changes in
                          the expected useful life or the
                          expected pattern of
                          consumption of future
                          economic benefits embodied
                          in the asset are considered
                          to modify the amortization
                          period or method, as
                          appropriate, and are treated
                          as changes in accounting
                          estimates. The amortization
                          expense on intangible assets
                          with finite lives is recognized
                          in the statement of profit or
                          loss in the expense category
                          that is consistent with the
                          function of the intangible
                          assets. The intangible assets
                          of the company are

                          assetsAt the end of each
                          reporting period, the
                          company reviews the
                          carrying amounts of its non-
                          financial assets to ​determine
                          whether there is any
                          indication that these assets
                          have suffered impairment
                          losses. If any such indication
                          ​exists, the recoverable
                           amount of the asset is
                           estimated in order to
                           determine impairment losses
                           (if any).In the ​event that it is
                           not possible to estimate the
                           recoverable value of a
                           specific asset, the company
                           estimates the ​recoverable
                           amount of the cash-
                           generating unit to which the
                           asset itself belongs. When a
                           reasonable and ​consistent
                           basis of allocation can be
                           identified, joint assets are
                           also allocated to cash
                           generating units, or they are
                           ​allocated to the smallest
                            group of cash generating
                            units for which a reasonable
                            and consistent basis of
                            allocation ​can be
                            identified.The cash-
                            generating unit to which the
                            goodwill has been allocated
                            is tested to determine the
                            ​annual impairment, whenever
                             there is an indication of
                             impairment of the unit by
                             comparing the book ​value of
                             the unit, including goodwill,
                             with the recoverable amount
                             of the unit.Intangible assets
                             with indefinite useful ​life are
                             not amortized. Instead, the
                             asset is tested for impairment
                             annually, whenever there is
                             an indication that the ​asset is
                             impaired.​The recoverable
                             amount is the higher of the
                             fair value of the asset less
                             disposal costs or use value.
                             In assessing ​value in use, the
                             estimated future cash flows
                             are discounted to their
                             present value using a pre-tax
                             discount rate that ​reflects
                             current market assessments
                             of the time value of money
                             and the risks specific to the
                             asset for which the ​future
                             cash flow assessment has
                             not been adjusted.​If the
                             recoverable amount of the
                             asset (or cash-generating
                             unit) is estimated to be less
                             than the carrying amount, ​the
                             carrying amount of the asset
                             (or cash-generating unit) is
                             reduced to the recoverable
                             value. Impairment losses ​are
                             recognized directly in profit or
                         loss.​When the impairment
                         loss is subsequently
                         reversed, the carrying
                         amount of the asset (or cash-
                         generating unit) is ​increased
                         to the recoverable
                         reassessment, so that the
                         revised carrying amount does
                         not exceed the value of the
                         ​asset (or cash-generating
                          unit) if the impairment loss is
                          not accounted for in the
                          previous years. The reversal
                          of an impairment loss is
                          recognized directly in profit or
                          loss. An impairment loss
                          recognized in previous
                          periods is not reversed for
                          goodwill in a subsequent
                          period.Impairment of
                          financial assetsA model is
                          followed for expected credit
                          losses from impairment of
                          financial assets. The
                          expected credit loss model
                          requires that the company
                          account for expected credit
                          losses and changes in those
                          expected credit losses at

                          initial registrationIFRS 9 uses
                          the “expected credit loss”
                          (ECL) model. The model is
                          applied to financial assets
                          that are measured at
                          amortized cost and to debt
                          instruments that are
                          measured at fair value
                          through other comprehensive
                          income, not to investments in

                          International Financial
                          Reporting Standard No. (9).
                          Measurement of ECL is
                          considered as an indication
                          of the probability of default, or
                          the given default loss
                          (meaning the size of the loss
                          if there is a default). The
                          assessment of the probability
                          of default is based on
                          historical data, which is
                          adjusted by information that
                          forecasts the future.The
                          company assesses, based

                          expected credit losses
                          associated with its debt
                          instruments as part of its

                          through other comprehensive
                          income.For trade receivable,
                          the company applies the
                          simplified approach, which
                          requires recording expected
                          losses on the basis of age

                          To measure expected credit
                          losses, receivables have

                            rate risk arises from changes

20. B.Fair value
measurementThe company
measures financial
instruments such as equity
instruments at fair value
through other comprehensive
income at each statement of
financial position date.The
fair value represents the
price received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly
transaction between market
participants at the
measurement date. The fair
value measurement is based
on the presumption that the
transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes
place either:In the principal
market for assets or
liabilitiesIn the non-existence
of the principle market, in the
most advantageous market
for the assets or
liabilities.The main or most
beneficial market must be
available to the
company.The fair value of
the assets or liabilities is
measured using assumptions
that market participants will
use them when pricing the
assets or liabilities and on
the assumption that market
participants seek to achieve
the best economic
benefits.The fair value
measurement of a non-
financial asset takes into
account the ability of market
participants to achieve
economic benefits by using
the asset in the best possible
way and the highest possible
interest, or by selling it to
another market participant,
who will use the asset in the
best and highest possible
interest.The following table

recorded at fair value
